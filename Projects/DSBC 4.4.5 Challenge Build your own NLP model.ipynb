      "good children, and Mary, when she considered that so much depended upon\r\n",
      "her, was resolved to exert herself to the utmost.  Her first care was to\r\n",
      "pay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her, for which she left\r\n",
      "money done up carefully in separate papers.  When all these were paid\r\n",
      "away, there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a\r\n",
      "year's schooling for herself and sisters which was due to the\r\n",
      "schoolmistress in a neighbouring village.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary was in hopes that the rent would not be called for immediately, but\r\n",
      "in this she was disappointed.  Mr. Harvey, the gentleman on whose estate\r\n",
      "she lived, was in England, and, in his absence, all was managed by a Mr.\r\n",
      "Hopkins, an agent, who was a HARD MAN.  The driver came to Mary about a\r\n",
      "week after her mother's death, and told her that the rent must be brought\r\n",
      "in the next day, and that she must leave the cabin, for a new tenant was\r\n",
      "coming into it; that she was too young to have a house to herself, and\r\n",
      "that the only thing she had to do was to get some neighbour to take her\r\n",
      "and her brother and her sisters in for charity's sake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A hard-hearted man.\r\n",

      "The driver finished by hinting that she would not be so hardly used if\r\n",
      "she had not brought upon herself the ill-will of Miss Alice, the agent's\r\n",
      "daughter.  Mary, it is true, had refused to give Miss Alice a goat upon\r\n",
      "which she had set her fancy; but this was the only offence of which she\r\n",
      "had been guilty, and at the time she refused it her mother wanted the\r\n",
      "goat's milk, which was the only thing she then liked to drink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary went immediately to Mr. Hopkins, the agent, to pay her rent; and she\r\n",
      "begged of him to let her stay another year in her cabin; but this he\r\n",
      "refused.  It was now September 25th, and he said that the new tenant must\r\n",
      "come in on the 29th, so that she must quit it directly.  Mary could not\r\n",
      "bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her\r\n",
      "brother and sisters in FOR CHARITY'S SAKE; for the neighbours were all\r\n",
      "poor enough themselves.  So she bethought herself that she might find\r\n",
      "shelter in the ruins of the old castle of Rossmore where she and her\r\n",
      "brother, in better times, had often played at hide and seek.  The kitchen\r\n",
      "and two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well; and a\r\n",
      "little thatch, she thought, would make them comfortable through the\r\n",
      "winter.  The agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in\r\n",
      "there, upon her paying him half a guinea in hand, and promising to pay\r\n",
      "the same yearly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Into these lodgings the orphans now removed, taking with them two\r\n",
      "bedsteads, a stool, chair and a table, a sort of press, which contained\r\n",
      "what little clothes they had, and a chest in which they had two hundred\r\n",
      "of meal.  The chest was carried for them by some of the charitable\r\n",
      "neighbours, who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf\r\n",
      "what would make it last through the winter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These children were well thought of and pitied, because their mother was\r\n",
      "known to have been all her life honest and industrious.  \"Sure,\" says one\r\n",
      "of the neighbours, \"we can do no less than give a helping hand to the\r\n",
      "poor orphans, that are so ready to help themselves.\"  So one helped to\r\n",
      "thatch the room in which they were to sleep, and another took their cow\r\n",
      "to graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk; and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The half-guinea which Mr. Hopkins, the agent, required for letting Mary\r\n",
      "into the castle, was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress,\r\n",
      "to whom above a guinea was due.  Mary went to her, and took her goat\r\n",
      "along with her, and offered it in part of payment of the debt, but the\r\n",
      "schoolmistress would not receive the goat. She said that she could afford\r\n",
      "to wait for her money till Mary was able to pay it; that she knew her to\r\n",
      "be an honest, industrious little girl, and she would trust her with more\r\n",
      "than a guinea.  Mary thanked her; and she was glad to take the goat home\r\n",

      "Being now settled in their house, they went every day regularly to work;\r\n",
      "Maud spun nine cuts a day, besides doing all that was to be done in the\r\n",
      "house; Edmund got fourpence a day by his work; and Peggy and Annie earned\r\n",
      "twopence apiece at the paper-mills near Navan, where they were employed\r\n",

      "the master would not take anything from her, but gave her the paper when\r\n",
      "he found that she wanted it to make a garland for her mother's grave.\r\n",
      "Annie and Peggy cut out the garland, and Mary, when it was finished, went\r\n",
      "along with them and Edmund to put it up.  It was just a month after their\r\n",
      "mother's death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened, at the time the orphans were putting up this garland, that\r\n",
      "two young ladies, who were returning home after their evening walk,\r\n",
      "stopped at the gate of the churchyard to look at the red light which the\r\n",
      "setting sun cast upon the window of the church.  As the ladies were\r\n",
      "standing at the gate, they heard a voice near them crying, \"O, mother!\r\n",
      "mother! are you gone for ever?\"  They could not see anyone, so they\r\n",
      "walked softly round to the other side of the church, and there they saw\r\n",
      "Mary kneeling beside a grave, on which her brothers and sisters were\r\n",
      "hanging their white garlands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The children all stood still when they saw the two ladies passing near\r\n",

      "her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella and Caroline so these ladies were called would not disturb the\r\n",
      "poor children; but they stopped in the village to inquire about them.  It\r\n",
      "was at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped, and she gave\r\n",
      "them a good account of these orphans.  She particularly commended Mary's\r\n",
      "honesty, in having immediately paid all her mother's debts to the utmost\r\n",
      "farthing, as far as her money would go.  She told the ladies how Mary had\r\n",
      "been turned out of her house, and how she had offered her goat, of which\r\n",
      "she was very fond, to discharge a debt due for her schooling; and, in\r\n",
      "short, the schoolmistress, who had known Mary for several years, spoke so\r\n",
      "well of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old\r\n",
      "castle of Rossmore to see her the next day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they went there, they found the room in which the children lived as\r\n",
      "clean and neat as such a ruined place could be made.  Edmund was out\r\n",
      "working with a farmer, Mary was spinning, and her little sisters were\r\n",
      "measuring out some bogberries, of which they had gathered a basketful,\r\n",
      "for sale.  Isabella, after telling Mary what an excellent character she\r\n",
      "had heard of her, inquired what it was she most wanted; and Mary said\r\n",
      "that she had just worked up all her flax, and she was most in want of\r\n",
      "more flax for her wheel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of flax, and\r\n",
      "Caroline bought the bogberries from the little girls, and gave them money\r\n",
      "enough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for knitting, as Mary said that\r\n",
      "she could teach them how to knit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The supply of flax, which Isabella sent the next day, was of great\r\n",
      "service to Mary, as it kept her in employment for above a month; and when\r\n",
      "she sold the yarn which she had spun with it, she had money enough to buy\r\n",
      "some warm flannel for winter wear.  Besides spinning well, she had\r\n",
      "learned at school to do plain work tolerably neatly, and Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline employed her to work for them; by which she earned a great deal\r\n",
      "more than she could by spinning.  At her leisure hours she taught her\r\n",
      "sisters to read and write; and Edmund, with part of the money which he\r\n",
      "earned by his work out of doors, paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a\r\n",
      "little arithmetic.  When the winter nights came on, he used to light his\r\n",
      "rush candles for Mary to work by.  He had gathered and stripped a good\r\n",
      "provision of rushes in the month of August, and a neighbour gave him\r\n",
      "grease to dip them in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, just as he had lighted his candles, a footman came in, who\r\n",
      "was sent by Isabella with some plain work to Mary.  This servant was an\r\n",
      "Englishman, and he was but newly come over to Ireland.  The rush candles\r\n",
      "caught his attention; for he had never seen any of them before, as he\r\n",
      "came from a part of England where they were not used.  Edmund, who was\r\n",
      "ready to oblige, and proud that his candles were noticed showed the\r\n",
      "Englishman how they were made, and gave him a bundle of rushes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The proper species of rush,\" says White, in his 'Natural History of\r\n",
      "Selborne,' \"seems to be the Juncus effusus, or common soft rush, which is\r\n",
      "to be found in moist pastures, by the sides of streams, and under\r\n",
      "hedges.  These rushes are in best condition in the height of summer, but\r\n",
      "may be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn.  The\r\n",
      "largest and longest are the best.  Decayed labourers, women, and children\r\n",
      "make it their business to procure and prepare them.  As soon as they are\r\n",
      "cut, they must be flung into water, and kept there; for otherwise they\r\n",
      "will dry and shrink, and the peel will not run.  When these junci are\r\n",
      "thus far prepared, they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take\r\n",
      "the dew for some nights, and afterwards be dried in the sun.  Some\r\n",
      "address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or\r\n",
      "grease; but this knack is also to be attained by practice.  A pound of\r\n",
      "common grease may be procured for fourpence, and about six pounds of\r\n",
      "grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought\r\n",
      "for one shilling; so that a pound of rushes, medicated and ready for use,\r\n",
      "will cost three shillings.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance,\r\n",
      "and remembered it long after it was forgotten by Edmund.  Whenever his\r\n",
      "master wanted to send a messenger anywhere, Gilbert for that was the\r\n",
      "servant's name always employed his little friend Edmund, whom, upon\r\n",
      "further acquaintance, he liked better and better.  He found that Edmund\r\n",
      "was both quick and exact in executing commissions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, after he had waited a great while at a gentleman's house for an\r\n",
      "answer to a letter, he was so impatient to get home that he ran off\r\n",
      "without it.  When he was questioned by Gilbert why he did not bring an\r\n",
      "answer, he did not attempt to make any excuse; he did not say, \"There was\r\n",
      "no answer, please your honour,\" or, \"They bid me not to wait,\" etc.; but\r\n",
      "he told exactly the truth; and though Gilbert scolded him for being so\r\n",
      "impatient as not to wait, yet his telling the truth was more to the boy's\r\n",
      "advantage than any excuse he could have made.  After this he was always\r\n",
      "believed when he said, \"There was no answer,\" or, \"They bid me not wait\";\r\n",
      "for Gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being\r\n",
      "scolded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to\r\n",
      "their strength and abilities; and they went on in this manner for three\r\n",
      "years.  With what Mary got by her spinning and plain work, and Edmund by\r\n",
      "leading of cart-horses, going on errands, etc., and with little Peggy and\r\n",
      "Anne's earnings, the family contrived to live comfortably.  Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline often visited them, and sometimes gave them clothes, and\r\n",
      "sometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting; and these\r\n",
      "children did not EXPECT, that because the ladies did something for them,\r\n",
      "they should do everything.  They did not grow idle or wasteful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Edmund was about twelve years old, his friend Gilbert sent for him\r\n",
      "one day, and told him that his master had given him leave to have a boy\r\n",
      "in the house to assist him, and that his master told him he might choose\r\n",
      "one in the neighbourhood.  Several were anxious to get into such a good\r\n",
      "place:  but Gilbert said that he preferred Edmund before them all,\r\n",
      "because he knew him to be an industrious, honest, good natured lad, who\r\n",
      "always told the truth.  So Edmund went into service at the vicarage; and\r\n",
      "his master was the father of Isabella and Caroline.  He found his new way\r\n",
      "of life very pleasant; for he was well fed, well clothed, and well\r\n",
      "treated; and he every day learned more of his business, in which at first\r\n",
      "he was rather awkward.  He was mindful to do all that Mr. Gilbert\r\n",
      "required of him; and he was so obliging to all his fellow-servants that\r\n",
      "they could not help liking him.  But there was one thing which was at\r\n",
      "first rather disagreeable to him:  he was obliged to wear shoes and\r\n",
      "stockings, and they hurt his feet.  Besides this, when he waited at\r\n",
      "dinner he made such a noise in walking that his fellow-servants laughed\r\n",
      "at him.  He told his sister Mary of his distress, and she made for him,\r\n",
      "after many trials, a pair of cloth shoes, with soles of platted hemp.\r\n",
      "In these he could walk without making the least noise; and as these shoes\r\n",
      "could not be worn out of doors, he was always sure to change them before\r\n",
      "he went out; and consequently he had always clean shoes to wear in the\r\n",
      "house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The author has seen a pair of shoes, such as here described, made in a\r\n",
      "few hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was soon remarked by the men-servants that he had left off clumping so\r\n",
      "heavily, and it was observed by the maids that he never dirtied the\r\n",
      "stairs or passages with his shoes.  When he was praised for these things,\r\n",
      "he said it was his sister Mary who should be thanked, and not he; and he\r\n",
      "showed the shoes which she had made for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella's maid bespoke a pair immediately, and sent Mary a piece of\r\n",
      "pretty calico for the outside.  The last-maker made a last for her, and\r\n",
      "over this Mary sewed the calico vamps tight.  Her brother advised her to\r\n",
      "try platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles; and she found that\r\n",
      "this looked more neat than the hemp soles, and was likely to last longer.\r\n",
      "She platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch\r\n",
      "thick, and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe.\r\n",
      "When they were finished they fitted well, and the maid showed them to her\r\n",
      "mistress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella and Caroline were so well pleased with Mary's ingenuity and\r\n",
      "kindness to her brother, that they bespoke from her two dozen of these\r\n",
      "shoes, and gave her three yards of coloured fustian to make them of, and\r\n",
      "galloon for the binding.  When the shoes were completed, Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance, and got\r\n",
      "three shillings a pair for them.  The young ladies, as soon as they had\r\n",
      "collected the money, walked to the old castle, where they found\r\n",
      "everything neat and clean as usual.  They had great pleasure in giving to\r\n",
      "this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity, which she received\r\n",
      "with some surprise and more gratitude.  They advised her to continue the\r\n",
      "shoemaking trade, as they found the shoes were liked, and they knew that\r\n",
      "they could have a sale for them at the Repository in Dublin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary, encouraged by these kind friends, went on with her little\r\n",
      "manufacture with increased activity.  Peggy and Anne platted the\r\n",
      "packthread, and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her.\r\n",
      "Edmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning, provided he\r\n",
      "was back again before eight o'clock.  It was summer time, and he got up\r\n",
      "early, because he liked to go home to see his sisters, and he took his\r\n",
      "share in the manufactory.  It was his business to hammer the soles flat:\r\n",
      "and as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so\r\n",
      "much cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work, that the hour of his\r\n",
      "arrival was always an hour of joy to the family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary had presently employment enough upon her hands.  Orders came to her\r\n",
      "for shoes from many families in the neighbourhood, and she could not get\r\n",
      "them finished fast enough.  She, however, in the midst of her hurry,\r\n",
      "found time to make a very pretty pair, with neat roses, as a present for\r\n",
      "her schoolmistress, who, now that she saw her pupil in a good way of\r\n",
      "business, consented to receive the amount of her old debt.  Several of\r\n",
      "the children who went to her school were delighted with the sight of\r\n",
      "Mary's present, and went to the little manufactory at Rossmore Castle, to\r\n",
      "find out how these shoes were made.  Some went from curiosity, others\r\n",
      "from idleness; but when they saw how happy the little shoemakers seemed\r\n",
      "whilst busy at work, they longed to take some share in what was going\r\n",
      "forward.  One begged Mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles;\r\n",
      "another helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the linings; and all who could\r\n",
      "get employment were pleased, for the idle ones were shoved out of the\r\n",
      "way.  It became a custom with the children of the village to resort to\r\n",
      "the old castle at their play hours; and it was surprising to see how much\r\n",
      "was done by ten or twelve of them, each doing but a little at a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning Edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very\r\n",
      "early, and they were busy at their work, all sitting round the meal\r\n",
      "chest, which served them for a table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My hands must be washed,\" said George, a little boy who came running in;\r\n",
      "\"I ran so fast that I might be in time, to go to work along with you all,\r\n",
      "that I tumbled down, and look how I have dirtied my hands.  Most haste\r\n",
      "worst speed.  My hands must be washed before I can do anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whilst George was washing his hands, two other little children, who had\r\n",
      "just finished their morning's work, came to him to beg that he would blow\r\n",
      "some soap bubbles for them, and they were all three eagerly blowing\r\n",
      "bubbles, and watching them mount into the air, when suddenly they were\r\n",
      "startled by a noise as loud as thunder.  They were in a sort of outer\r\n",
      "court of the castle, next to the room in which all their companions were\r\n",
      "at work, and they ran precipitately into the room, exclaiming, \"Did you\r\n",
      "hear that noise?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought I heard a clap of thunder,\" said Mary, \"but why do you look so\r\n",
      "frightened?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she finished speaking, another and a louder noise, and the walls round\r\n",
      "about them shook.  The children turned pale and stood motionless; but\r\n",
      "Edmund threw down his hammer, and ran out to see what was the matter.\r\n",
      "Mary followed him, and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruins at\r\n",
      "the farthest side of the castle had fallen down, and this was the cause\r\n",
      "of the prodigious noise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The part of the castle in which they lived seemed, as Edmund said, to be\r\n",
      "perfectly safe; but the children of the village were terrified, and\r\n",
      "thinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly, they ran to\r\n",
      "their homes as fast as they could.  Edmund, who was a courageous lad, and\r\n",
      "proud of showing his courage, laughed at their cowardice; but Mary, who\r\n",
      "was very prudent, persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason, who\r\n",
      "was building at his master's, to come and give his opinion, whether their\r\n",
      "part of the castle was safe to live in or not.  The mason came, and gave\r\n",
      "it as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the\r\n",
      "winter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year.  Mary was\r\n",
      "sorry to leave a place of which she had grown fond, poor as it was,\r\n",
      "having lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her mother's\r\n",
      "death, which was now nearly four years; but she determined to look out\r\n",
      "for some other place to live in; and she had now money enough to pay the\r\n",
      "rent of a comfortable cabin.  Without losing any time, she went to the\r\n",
      "village that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage, for\r\n",
      "she wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her\r\n",
      "brother, and to the ladies who had been so kind to her.  She found that\r\n",
      "there was one newly built house in this village unoccupied; it belonged\r\n",
      "to Mr. Harvey, her landlord, who was still in England; it was slated, and\r\n",
      "neatly fitted up inside; but the rent of it was six guineas a year, and\r\n",
      "this was far above what Mary could afford to pay.  Three guineas a year\r\n",
      "she thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage.\r\n",
      "Besides, she heard that several proposals had been made to Mr. Harvey for\r\n",
      "this house, and she knew that Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was not her friend;\r\n",
      "therefore she despaired of getting it.  There was no other to be had in\r\n",
      "this village.  Her brother was still more vexed than she was, that she\r\n",
      "could not find a place near him.  He offered to give a guinea yearly\r\n",
      "towards the rent out of his wages; and Mr. Gilbert spoke about it for him\r\n",
      "to the steward, and inquired whether, amongst any of those who had given\r\n",
      "in proposals, there might not be one who would be content with a part of\r\n",
      "the house, and who would join with Mary in paying the rent.  None could\r\n",
      "be found but a woman, who was a great scold, and a man who was famous for\r\n",
      "going to law about every trifle with his neighbours.  Mary did not choose\r\n",
      "to have anything to do with these people.  She did not like to speak\r\n",
      "either to Miss Isabella or Caroline about it, because she was not of an\r\n",
      "encroaching temper; and when they had done so much for her, she would\r\n",
      "have been ashamed to beg for more.  She returned home to the old castle,\r\n",
      "mortified that she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy, who she knew\r\n",
      "expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village\r\n",
      "near their brother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bad news for you, Peggy,\" cried she, as soon as she got home.  \"And bad\r\n",
      "news for you, Mary,\" replied her sisters, who looked very sorrowful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your poor goat is dead,\" replied Peggy.  \"There she is, yonder, lying\r\n",
      "under the great corner stone; you can just see her leg.  We cannot lift\r\n",
      "the stone from off her, it is so heavy.  Betsy one of the neighbour's\r\n",
      "girls says she remembers, when she came to us to work early this\r\n",
      "morning, she saw the goat rubbing itself, and butting with its horns\r\n",
      "against that old tottering chimney.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Many's the time,\" said Mary, \"that I have driven the poor thing away\r\n",
      "from that place; I was always afraid she would shake that great ugly\r\n",
      "stone down upon her at last.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The goat, who had long been the favourite of Mary and her sisters, was\r\n",
      "lamented by them all.  When Edmund came, he helped them to move the great\r\n",
      "stone from off the poor animal, who was crushed so as to be a terrible\r\n",
      "sight.  As they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat,\r\n",
      "Anne found an odd-looking piece of money, which seemed neither like a\r\n",
      "halfpenny, nor a shilling, nor a guinea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here are more, a great many more of them,\" cried Peggy; and upon\r\n",
      "searching amongst the rubbish, they discovered a small iron pot, which\r\n",
      "seemed as if it had been filled with these coins, as a vast number of\r\n",
      "them were found about the spot where it fell.  On examining these coins,\r\n",
      "Edmund thought that several of them looked like gold, and the girls\r\n",
      "exclaimed with great joy--\"Oh, Mary! Mary! this is come to us just in\r\n",
      "right time--now you can pay for the slated house.  Never was anything so\r\n",
      "lucky!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary, though nothing could have pleased her better than to have been\r\n",
      "able to pay for the house, observed that they could not honestly touch\r\n",
      "any of this treasure, as it belonged to the owner of the castle.  Edmund\r\n",
      "agreed with her, that they ought to carry it all immediately to Mr.\r\n",
      "Hopkins, the agent. Peggy and Anne were convinced by what Mary said, and\r\n",
      "they begged to go along with her and their brother, to take the coins to\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins.  On their way they stopped at the vicarage, to show the\r\n",
      "treasure to Mr. Gilbert, who took it to the young ladies, Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline, and told them how it had been found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not only by their superior riches, but it is yet more by their\r\n",
      "superior knowledge, that persons in the higher rank of life may assist\r\n",
      "those in a lower condition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella, who had some knowledge of chemistry, discovered, by touching\r\n",
      "the coins with nitric acid, that several of them were of gold, and\r\n",
      "consequently of great value.  Caroline also found out that many of the\r\n",
      "coins were very valuable as curiosities.  She recollected her father's\r\n",
      "having shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each king's\r\n",
      "reign, in \"Rapin's History of England;\" and upon comparing these\r\n",
      "impressions with the coins found by the orphans, she perceived that many\r\n",
      "of them were of the reign of Henry the Seventh, which, from their\r\n",
      "scarcity, were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella and Caroline, knowing something of the character of Mr. Hopkins,\r\n",
      "the agent, had the precaution to count the coins, and to mark each of\r\n",
      "them with a cross, so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked\r\n",
      "eye, though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass.  They\r\n",
      "also begged that their father, who was well acquainted with Mr. Harvey,\r\n",
      "the gentleman to whom Rossmore Castle belonged, to write to him, and tell\r\n",
      "him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had\r\n",
      "found.  The value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty\r\n",
      "guineas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few days after the fall of the chimney at Rossmore Castle, as Mary and\r\n",
      "her sisters were sitting at their work, there came hobbling in an old\r\n",
      "woman, leaning on a crab stick, that seemed to have been newly cut.  She\r\n",
      "had a broken tobacco-pipe in her mouth; her head was wrapped up in two\r\n",
      "large red and blue handkerchiefs, with their crooked corners hanging far\r\n",
      "down over the back of her neck, no shoes on her broad feet, nor stockings\r\n",
      "on her many-coloured legs.  Her petticoat was jagged at the bottom, and\r\n",
      "the skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders, to serve instead of a\r\n",
      "cloak, which she had sold for whisky.  This old woman was well known\r\n",
      "amongst the country people by the name of Goody Grope:  because she had,\r\n",
      "for many years, been in the habit of groping in old castles, and in\r\n",
      "moats, and at the bottom of a round tower in the neighbourhood, in\r\n",
      "search of treasure.  In her youth she had heard someone talking, in a\r\n",
      "whisper, of an old prophecy, found in a bog, which said that before many\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     \"St. Patrick's days should come about,\r\n",
      "      There would be found\r\n",
      "      A treasure under ground,\r\n",
      "      By one within twenty miles round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This prophecy made a deep impression upon her.  She also dreamed of it\r\n",
      "three times:  and as the dream, she thought, was a sure token that the\r\n",
      "prophecy was to come true, she, from that time forwards, gave up her\r\n",
      "spinning-wheel and her knitting, and could think of nothing but hunting\r\n",
      "for the treasure, that was to be found by one \"within twenty miles\r\n",
      "round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Goody is not a word used in Ireland.  Collyogh is the Irish appellation\r\n",
      "of an old woman:  but as Collyogh might sound strangely to English ears,\r\n",
      "we have translated it by the word Goody.\r\n",
      "What are in Ireland called moats, are, in England, called Danish\r\n",
      "mounds, or barrows.\r\n",
      "Near Kells, in Ireland, there is a round tower, which was in imminent\r\n",

      "in hopes of finding treasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Year after year St. Patrick's day came about, without her ever finding a\r\n",
      "farthing by all her groping; and as she was always idle, she grew poorer\r\n",
      "and poorer.  Besides, to comfort herself for her disappointments, and to\r\n",
      "give her spirits for fresh searches, she took to drinking.  She sold all\r\n",
      "she had by degrees; but still she fancied that the lucky day would come\r\n",
      "sooner or later, THAT WOULD PAY FOR ALL.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Goody Grope, however, reached her sixtieth year, without ever seeing this\r\n",
      "lucky day; and now, in her old age, she was a beggar, without a house to\r\n",
      "shelter her, a bed to lie on, or food to put into her mouth, but what she\r\n",
      "begged from the charity of those who had trusted more than she had to\r\n",
      "industry and less to LUCK.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "and a halfpenny worth of tobacco!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary immediately set before her some milk, and picked a good potato out\r\n",
      "of the bowl for her.  She was sorry to see such an old woman in such a\r\n",
      "wretched condition.  Goody Grope said she would rather have spirits of\r\n",
      "some kind or other than milk; but Mary had no spirits to give her; so she\r\n",
      "sat herself down close to the fire, and after she had sighed and groaned\r\n",
      "and smoked for some time, she said to Mary, \"Well, and what have you done\r\n",
      "with the treasure you had the luck to find?\"  Mary told her that she had\r\n",
      "carried it to Mr. Hopkins, the agent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's not what I would have done in your place,\" replied the old woman.\r\n",

      "it was more than twenty miles from our bog or I would have been here long\r\n",
      "ago; but better late than never.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary was much alarmed, and not without reason, at this speech; for she\r\n",
      "knew that if Goody Grope once set to work at the foundation of the old\r\n",
      "castle of Rossmore, she would soon bring it all down.  It was in vain to\r\n",
      "talk to Goody Grope of the danger of burying herself under the ruins, or\r\n",
      "of the improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold coins.  She\r\n",
      "set her elbow upon her knees, and stopping her ears with her hands bid\r\n",
      "Mary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders; for\r\n",
      "that, let them say what they would, she would fall to work the next\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Half a crown, Goody Grope said, was the least she could be content to\r\n",
      "take.  Mary paid the half-crown, and was in hopes that she had got rid\r\n",
      "for ever of her tormentor, but she was mistaken, for scarcely was the\r\n",
      "week at an end before the old woman appeared before her again, and\r\n",
      "repeated her threats of falling to work the next morning, unless she had\r\n",
      "something given to her to buy tobacco.\r\n",

      "halfpence, at last exclaimed, \"I am sure the finding of this treasure has\r\n",
      "not been any good luck to us, but quite the contrary; and I wish we never\r\n",
      "had found it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this\r\n",
      "unfortunate pot of gold coins.  Mr. Hopkins, the agent, imagined that no\r\n",
      "one knew of the discovery of this treasure but himself and these poor\r\n",
      "children; so, not being as honest as they were, he resolved to keep it\r\n",
      "for his own use.  He was surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a\r\n",
      "letter from his employer, Mr. Harvey, demanding from him the coins which\r\n",
      "had been discovered at Rossmore Castle.  Hopkins had sold the gold coins,\r\n",
      "and some of the others; and he flattered himself that the children, and\r\n",
      "the young ladies, to whom he now found they had been shown, could not\r\n",
      "tell whether what they had seen were gold or not, and he was not in the\r\n",
      "least apprehensive that those of Henry the Seventh's reign should be\r\n",
      "reclaimed from him as he thought they had escaped attention.  So he sent\r\n",
      "over the silver coins and others of little value, and apologized for his\r\n",
      "not having mentioned them before, by saying that he considered them as\r\n",
      "mere rubbish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Harvey, in reply, observed that he could not consider as rubbish the\r\n",
      "gold coins which were amongst them when they were discovered; and he\r\n",
      "inquired why these gold coins, and those of the reign of Henry the\r\n",
      "Seventh, were not now sent to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins denied that he had ever received any such; but he was\r\n",
      "thunderstruck when Mr. Harvey, in reply to this falsehood, sent him a\r\n",
      "list of the coins which the orphans had deposited with him, and exact\r\n",
      "drawings of those that were missing.  He informed him that this list and\r\n",
      "these drawings came from two ladies who had seen the coins in question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by boldly\r\n",
      "persisting in falsehood.  He replied, that it was very likely such coins\r\n",
      "had been found at Rossmore Castle, and that the ladies alluded to had\r\n",
      "probably seen them; but he positively declared that they never came to\r\n",
      "his hands; that he had restored all that were deposited with him; and\r\n",
      "that, as to the others, he supposed they must have been taken out of the\r\n",
      "pot by the children, or by Edmund or Mary on their way from the ladies'\r\n",
      "house to his.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard, from Isabella\r\n",
      "and Caroline, the charge that was made against them.  They looked at one\r\n",
      "another in silence for some moments.  Then Peggy exclaimed--\"Sure!  Mr.\r\n",
      "Hopkins has forgotten himself strangely.  Does not he remember Edmund's\r\n",
      "counting the things to him upon the great table in his hall, and we all\r\n",
      "standing by!  I remember it as well as if it was this instant.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And so do I,\" cried Anne.  \"And don't you recollect, Mary, your picking\r\n",
      "out the gold ones, and telling Mr. Hopkins that they were gold; and he\r\n",
      "said you knew nothing of the matter; and I was going to tell him that\r\n",
      "Miss Isabella had tried them, and knew that they were gold? but just then\r\n",
      "there came in some tenants to pay their rent, and he pushed us out, and\r\n",
      "twitched from my hand the piece of gold which I had taken up to show him\r\n",
      "the bright spot which Miss Isabella had cleaned by the stuff that she had\r\n",
      "poured on it?  I believe he was afraid I should steal it; he twitched it\r\n",
      "from my hand in such a hurry.  Do, Edmund; do, Mary--let us go to him,\r\n",
      "and put him in mind of all this.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll go to him no more,\" said Edmund, sturdily.  \"He is a bad man--I'll\r\n",
      "never go to him again.  Mary, don't be cast down--we have no need to be\r\n",
      "cast down--we are honest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"True,\" said Mary; \"but is not it a hard case that we, who have lived, as\r\n",
      "my mother did all her life before us, in peace and honesty with all the\r\n",
      "world, should now have our good name taken from us, when--\"  Mary's voice\r\n",
      "faltered and stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It can't be taken from us,\" cried Edmund, \"poor orphans though we are,\r\n",
      "and he a rich gentleman, as he calls himself.  Let him say and do what he\r\n",
      "will, he can't hurt our good name.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Edmund was mistaken, alas! and Mary had but too much reason for her\r\n",
      "fears.  The affair was a great deal talked of; and the agent spared no\r\n",
      "pains to have the story told his own way.  The orphans, conscious of\r\n",
      "their own innocence, took no pains about the matter; and the consequence\r\n",
      "was, that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty; but many,\r\n",
      "who knew nothing of them, concluded that the agent must be in the right\r\n",
      "and the children in the wrong.  The buzz of scandal went on for some time\r\n",
      "without reaching their ears, because they lived very retiredly.  But one\r\n",
      "day, when Mary went to sell some stockings of Peggy's knitting at the\r\n",
      "neighbouring fair, the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name\r\n",
      "on the back of a note, and exclaimed, on seeing it--\"Ho! ho! mistress;\r\n",
      "I'd not have had any dealings with you, had I known your name sooner.\r\n",
      "Where's the gold that you found at Rossmore Castle?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was in vain that Mary related the fact.  She saw that she gained no\r\n",
      "belief, as her character was not known to this man, or to any of those\r\n",
      "who were present.  She left the fair as soon as she could; and though she\r\n",
      "struggled against it, she felt very melancholy.  Still she exerted\r\n",
      "herself every day at her little manufacture; and she endeavoured to\r\n",
      "console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not\r\n",
      "give up her character, and who continued steadily to protect her and her\r\n",
      "sisters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity\r\n",
      "of the orphans, but to prove it was in this instance out of their power.\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins, the agent, and his friends, constantly repeated that the\r\n",
      "gold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his; and these\r\n",
      "ladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those\r\n",
      "that were, with great reason, suspected to be thieves.  The orphans were\r\n",
      "in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on, and their\r\n",
      "benefactresses left the country to spend some months in Dublin.  The old\r\n",
      "castle, it was true, was likely to last through the winter, as the mason\r\n",
      "said; but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was, a little\r\n",
      "while ago, the uppermost thing in Mary's thoughts, now it was not so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night as Mary was going to bed, she heard someone knocking hard at\r\n",
      "the door.  \"Mary, are you up? let us in,\" cried a voice, which she knew\r\n",
      "to be the voice of Betsy Green, the postmaster's daughter, who lived in\r\n",
      "the village near them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She let Betsy in, and asked what she could want at such a time of night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give me sixpence, and I'll tell you,\" said Betsy; \"but waken Anne and\r\n",
      "Peggy.  Here's a letter just come by post for you, and I stepped over to\r\n",
      "you with it; because I guessed you'd be glad to have it, seeing it is\r\n",
      "your brother's handwriting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "from Edmund.  It was by one of his rush candles that Mary read it; and\r\n",
      "the letter was as follows:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"DEAR MARY, NANCY, AND LITTLE PEG,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Joy! joy!--I always said the truth would come out at last; and that he\r\n",
      "could not take our good name from us.  But I will not tell you how it all\r\n",
      "came about till we meet, which will be next week, as we are I mean,\r\n",
      "master and mistress, and the young ladies--bless them!--and Mr. Gilbert\r\n",
      "and I coming down to the vicarage to keep Christmas; and a happy\r\n",
      "Christmas 'tis likely to be for honest folks.  As for they that are not\r\n",
      "honest, it is not for them to expect to be happy, at Christmas, or any\r\n",
      "other time.  You shall know all when we meet.  So, till then, fare ye\r\n",
      "well, dear Mary, Nancy, and little Peg.\r\n",
      "                 \"Your joyful and affectionate brother,    EDMUND.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To comprehend why Edmund is joyful, our readers must be informed of\r\n",
      "certain things which happened after Isabella and Caroline went to Dublin.\r\n",
      "One morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent\r\n",
      "library of a nobleman, who took generous and polite pleasure in thus\r\n",
      "sharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any\r\n",
      "pretensions to science or literature.  Knowing that the gentleman who was\r\n",
      "now come to see his library was skilled in antiquities, the nobleman\r\n",
      "opened a drawer of medals, to ask his opinion concerning the age of some\r\n",
      "coins, which he had lately purchased at a high price.  They were the very\r\n",
      "same which the orphans had found at Rossmore Castle.  Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline knew them again instantly; and as the cross which Isabella had\r\n",
      "made on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass, there\r\n",
      "could be no possibility of doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The nobleman, who was much interested both by the story of these orphans,\r\n",
      "and the manner in which it was told to him, sent immediately for the\r\n",
      "person from whom he had purchased the coins.  He was a Jew broker.  At\r\n",
      "first he refused to tell them from whom he got them, because he had\r\n",
      "bought them, he said, under a promise of secrecy.  Being further pressed,\r\n",
      "he acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he\r\n",
      "should not sell them to anyone in Ireland, but that he had been tempted\r\n",
      "by the high price the present noble possessor had offered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last, when the Jew was informed that the coins were stolen, and that\r\n",
      "he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods, if he did\r\n",
      "not confess the whole truth, he declared that he had purchased them from\r\n",
      "a gentleman, whom he had never seen before or since; but he added, that\r\n",
      "he could swear to his person, if he saw him again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was at this time in Dublin, and Caroline's\r\n",
      "father posted the Jew, the next day, in the back-parlour of a banker's\r\n",
      "house, with whom Mr. Hopkins had, on this day, appointed to settle some\r\n",
      "accounts.  Mr. Hopkins came--the Jew knew him--swore that he was the man\r\n",
      "who had sold the coins to him; and thus the guilt of the agent and the\r\n",
      "innocence of the orphans were completely proved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A full account of all that happened was sent to England to Mr. Harvey,\r\n",
      "their landlord, and a few posts afterwards there came a letter from him,\r\n",
      "containing a dismissal of the dishonest agent, and a reward for the\r\n",
      "honest and industrious orphans.  Mr. Harvey desired that Mary and her\r\n",
      "sisters might have the slated house, rent free, from this time forward,\r\n",
      "under the care of ladies Isabella and Caroline, as long as Mary or her\r\n",

      "All the neighbours shared in their joy, and the day of their removal from\r\n",
      "the ruins of Rossmore Castle to their new house was the happiest of the\r\n",
      "Christmas holidays.  They were not envied for their prosperity; because\r\n",
      "everybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct; everybody\r\n",
      "except Goody Grope.  She exclaimed, as she wrung her hands with violent\r\n",
      "expressions of sorrow--\"Bad luck to me! bad luck to me!--Why didn't I go\r\n",
      "sooner to that there castle?  It is all luck, all luck in this world; but\r\n",
      "I never had no luck.  Think of the luck of these childer, that have found\r\n",
      "a pot of gold, and such great, grand friends, and a slated house, and\r\n",
      "all:  and here am I, with scarce a rag to cover me, and not a potato to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Phoo! phoo!\" interrupted Goody Grope; \"don't be prating; don't I know as\r\n",

      "In the pleasant valley of Ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name\r\n",
      "of Preston.  She had a small neat cottage, and there was not a weed to be\r\n",
      "seen in her garden.  It was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for\r\n",
      "support; it consisted of strawberry beds, and one small border for\r\n",
      "flowers.  The pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays, and sent\r\n",
      "either to Clifton or Bristol to be sold.  As to her strawberries, she did\r\n",
      "not send them to market, because it was the custom for numbers of people\r\n",
      "to come from Clifton, in the summer time, to eat strawberries and cream\r\n",
      "at the gardens in Ashton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the widow Preston was so obliging, active and good-humoured, that\r\n",
      "everyone who came to see her was pleased.  She lived happily in this\r\n",
      "manner for several years; but, alas! one autumn she fell sick, and,\r\n",
      "during her illness, everything went wrong; her garden was neglected, her\r\n",
      "cow died, and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for\r\n",
      "medicines. The winter passed away, while she was so weak that she could\r\n",
      "earn but little by her work; and when the summer came, her rent was\r\n",
      "called for, and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual.  She\r\n",
      "begged a few months' delay, and they were granted to her; but at the end\r\n",
      "of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot.  Now\r\n",
      "Lightfoot, though perhaps he had seen his best days, was a very great\r\n",
      "favourite. In his youth he had always carried the dame to the market\r\n",
      "behind her husband; and it was now her little son Jem's turn to ride him.\r\n",
      "It was Jem's business to feed Lightfoot, and to take care of him--a\r\n",
      "charge which he never neglected, for, besides being a very good natured,\r\n",
      "he was a very industrious boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It will go near to break my Jem's heart,\" said Dame Preston to herself,\r\n",
      "as she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers, and\r\n",
      "considering how she had best open the matter to her son, who stood\r\n",
      "opposite to her, eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Jem,\" said the old woman, \"what, ar't hungry?\"\r\n",

      "\"That I am, brave and hungry!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ay! no wonder, you've been brave hard at work--Eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Brave hard!  I wish it was not so dark, mother, that you might just step\r\n",
      "out and see the great bed I've dug; I know you'd say it was no bad day's\r\n",
      "work--and oh, mother! I've good news:  Farmer Truck will give us the\r\n",
      "giant strawberries, and I'm to go for 'em tomorrow morning, and I'll be\r\n",
      "back afore breakfast.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "again, afore breakfast.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ay, upon Lightfoot, you know, mother, very easily; mayn't I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ay, child!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do you sigh, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Finish thy supper, child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've done!\" cried Jem, swallowing the last mouthful hastily, as if he\r\n",
      "thought he had been too long at supper--\"and now for the great needle; I\r\n",
      "must see and mend Lightfoot's bridle afore I go to bed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To work he set, by the light of the fire, and the dame having once more\r\n",
      "stirred it, began again with \"Jem, dear, does he go lame at all now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What, Lightfoot!  Oh, la, no, not he--never was so well of his lameness\r\n",
      "in all his life.  He's grown quite young again, I think, and then he's so\r\n",
      "fat he can hardly wag.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"God bless him--that's right.  We must see, Jem, and keep him fat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For what, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For Monday fortnight at the fair.  He's to be--sold!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lightfoot!\" cried Jem, and let the bridle fall from his hand; \"and WILL\r\n",
      "mother sell Lightfoot?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"WILL? no:  but I MUST, Jem.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"MUST! who says you MUST? why MUST you, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I must, I say, child.  Why, must not I pay my debts honestly; and must\r\n",
      "not I pay my rent, and was not it called for long and long ago; and have\r\n",
      "not I had time; and did not I promise to pay it for certain Monday\r\n",
      "fortnight, and am not I two guineas short; and where am I to get two\r\n",
      "guineas?  So what signifies talking, child?\" said the widow, leaning her\r\n",
      "head upon her arm.  \"Lightfoot MUST go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem was silent for a few minutes--\"Two guineas, that's a great, great\r\n",
      "deal.  If I worked, and worked, and worked ever so hard, I could no ways\r\n",
      "earn two guineas AFORE Monday fortnight--could I, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord help thee, no; not an' work thyself to death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I could earn something, though, I say,\" cried Jem, proudly; \"and I\r\n",
      "WILL earn SOMETHING--if it be ever so little, it will be SOMETHING--and I\r\n",
      "shall do my very best; so I will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I'm sure of, my child,\" said his mother, drawing him towards her\r\n",
      "and kissing him; \"you were always a good, industrious lad, THAT I will\r\n",
      "say afore your face or behind your back;--but it won't do now--Lightfoot\r\n",
      "MUST go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem turned away struggling to hide his tears, and went to bed without\r\n",
      "saying a word more.  But he knew that crying would do no good; so he\r\n",
      "presently wiped his eyes, and lay awake, considering what he could\r\n",
      "possibly do to save the horse.  \"If I get ever so little,\" he still said\r\n",
      "to himself, \"it will be SOMETHING; and who knows but landlord might then\r\n",
      "wait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in time; for a penny a day\r\n",
      "might come to two guineas in time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But how to get the first penny was the question.  Then he recollected\r\n",
      "that one day, when he had been sent to Clifton to sell some flowers, he\r\n",
      "had seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various\r\n",
      "sparkling stones, which people stopped to look at as they passed, and he\r\n",
      "remembered that some people bought the stones; one paid twopence, another\r\n",
      "threepence, and another sixpence for them; and Jem heard her say that she\r\n",
      "got them amongst the neighbouring rocks:  so he thought that if he tried\r\n",
      "he might find some too, and sell them as she had done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme, jumped up, dressed\r\n",
      "himself, and, having given one look at poor Lightfoot in his stable, set\r\n",
      "off to Clifton in search of the old woman, to inquire where she found her\r\n",
      "sparkling stones.  But it was too early in the morning, the old woman was\r\n",
      "not at her seat; so he turned back again, disappointed.  He did not waste\r\n",
      "his time waiting for her, but saddled and bridled Lightfoot, and went to\r\n",
      "Farmer Truck's for the giant strawberries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground;\r\n",
      "and, as soon as that was finished, he set out again in quest of the old\r\n",
      "woman, whom, to his great joy, he spied sitting at her corner of the\r\n",
      "street with her board before her.  But this old woman was deaf and cross;\r\n",
      "and when at last Jem made her hear his questions, he could get no answer\r\n",
      "from her, but that she found the fossils where he would never find any\r\n",
      "more.  \"But can't I look where you looked?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look away, nobody hinders you,\" replied the old woman; and these were\r\n",
      "the only words she would say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem was not, however, a boy to be easily discouraged; he went to the\r\n",
      "rocks, and walked slowly along, looking at all the stones as he passed.\r\n",
      "Presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening\r\n",
      "some large rocks, and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking\r\n",
      "for something very eagerly; Jem ran up, and asked if he could help him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the man, \"you can; I've just dropped, amongst this heap of\r\n",
      "rubbish, a fine piece of crystal that I got to-day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What kind of a looking thing is it?\" said Jem.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"White, and like glass,\" said the man, and went on working whilst Jem\r\n",
      "looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come,\" said the man, \"it's gone for ever; don't trouble yourself any\r\n",
      "more, my boy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's no trouble; I'll look a little longer; we'll not give it up so\r\n",
      "soon,\" said Jem; and after he had looked a little longer, he found the\r\n",
      "piece of crystal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank'e,\" said the man, \"you are a fine little industrious fellow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem, encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this,\r\n",
      "ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One good turn deserves another,\" said the man; \"we are going to dinner\r\n",
      "just now, and shall leave off work--wait for me here, and I'll make it\r\n",
      "worth your while.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem waited; and, as he was very attentively observing how the workmen\r\n",
      "went on with their work, he heard somebody near him give a great yawn,\r\n",
      "and, turning round, he saw stretched upon the grass, beside the river, a\r\n",
      "boy about his own age, who, in the village of Ashton, as he knew, went by\r\n",
      "the name of Lazy Lawrence--a name which he most justly deserved, for he\r\n",
      "never did anything from morning to night.  He neither worked nor played,\r\n",
      "but sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning.  His father was an\r\n",
      "ale-house keeper, and being generally drunk, could take no care of his\r\n",
      "son; so that Lazy Lawrence grew every day worse and worse.  However, some\r\n",
      "of the neighbours said that he was a good natured, poor fellow enough,\r\n",
      "and would never do anyone harm but himself; whilst others, who were\r\n",
      "wiser, often shook their heads, and told him that idleness was the root\r\n",
      "of all evil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What, Lawrence!\" cried Jem to him, when he saw him lying upon the grass;\r\n",
      "\"what, are you asleep?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not quite.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you awake?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not quite.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What are you doing there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What are you thinking of?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What makes you lie there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know--because I can't find anybody to play with me to-day.  Will\r\n",
      "you come and play?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I can't; I'm busy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Busy,\" cried Lawrence, stretching himself, \"you are always busy.  I\r\n",
      "would not be you for the world, to have so much to do always.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I,\" said Jem, laughing, \"would not be you for the world, to have\r\n",
      "nothing to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They then parted, for the workman just then called Jem to follow him.  He\r\n",
      "took him home to his own house, and showed him a parcel of fossils, which\r\n",
      "he had gathered, he said, on purpose to sell, but had never had time\r\n",
      "enough to sell them.  Now, however, he set about the task; and having\r\n",
      "picked out those which he judged to be the best, he put them in a small\r\n",
      "basket, and gave them to Jem to sell, upon condition that he should bring\r\n",
      "him half of what he got.  Jem, pleased to be employed, was ready to agree\r\n",
      "to what the man proposed, provided his mother had no objection.  When he\r\n",
      "went home to dinner, he told his mother his scheme, and she smiled, and\r\n",
      "said he might do as he pleased; for she was not afraid of his being from\r\n",
      "home.  \"You are not an idle boy,\" said she; \"so there is little danger of\r\n",
      "your getting into any mischief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Accordingly Jem that evening took his stand, with his little basket, upon\r\n",
      "the bank of the river, just at the place where people land from a ferry-\r\n",
      "boat, and the walk turns to the wells, and numbers of people perpetually\r\n",
      "pass to drink the waters.  He chose his place well, and waited nearly all\r\n",
      "the evening, offering his fossils with great assiduity to every\r\n",
      "passenger; but not one person bought any.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" cried some sailors, who had just rowed a boat to land, \"bear a\r\n",
      "hand here, will you, my little fellow, and carry these parcels for us\r\n",
      "into yonder house?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem ran down immediately for the parcels, and did what he was asked to do\r\n",
      "so quickly, and with so much good-will, that the master of the boat took\r\n",
      "notice of him, and, when he was going away, stopped to ask him what he\r\n",
      "had got in his little basket; and when he saw that they were fossils, he\r\n",
      "immediately told Jem to follow him, for that he was going to carry some\r\n",
      "shells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was\r\n",
      "making a grotto.  \"She will very likely buy your stones into the bargain.\r\n",
      "Come along, my lad; we can but try.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady lived but a very little way off, so that they were soon at her\r\n",
      "house.  She was alone in her parlour, and was sorting a bundle of\r\n",
      "feathers of different colours; they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a\r\n",
      "window seat, and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the\r\n",
      "table to show off his shells, he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard,\r\n",
      "and scattered all the feathers.  The lady looked very sorry, which Jem\r\n",
      "observing, he took the opportunity, whilst she was busy looking over the\r\n",
      "sailor's bag of shells, to gather together all the feathers, and sort\r\n",
      "them according to their different colours, as he had seen them sorted\r\n",
      "when he first came into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where is the little boy you brought with you?  I thought I saw him here\r\n",
      "just now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And here I am, ma'am,\" cried Jem, creeping from under the table, with\r\n",
      "some few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet; \"I\r\n",
      "thought,\" added he, pointing to the others, \"I had better be doing\r\n",
      "something than standing idle, ma'am.\"  She smiled, and, pleased with his\r\n",
      "activity and simplicity, began to ask him several questions; such as who\r\n",
      "he was, where he lived, what employment he had, and how much a day he\r\n",
      "earned by gathering fossils.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is the first day I ever tried,\" said Jem; \"I never sold any yet,\r\n",
      "and if you don't buy 'em now, ma'am, I'm afraid nobody else will; for\r\n",
      "I've asked everybody else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" said the lady, laughing, \"if that is the case, I think I\r\n",
      "had better buy them all.\"  So, emptying all the fossils out of his\r\n",
      "basket, she put half a crown into it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem's eyes sparkled with joy.  \"Oh, thank you, ma'am,\" said he, \"I will\r\n",
      "be sure and bring you as many more, to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but I don't promise you,\" said she, \"to give you half a crown, to-\r\n",
      "morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, perhaps, though you don't promise it, you will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said the lady, \"do not deceive yourself; I assure you that I will\r\n",
      "not.  THAT, instead of encouraging you to be industrious, would teach you\r\n",
      "to be idle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem did not quite understand what she meant by this, but answered, \"I'm\r\n",
      "sure I don't wish to be idle; what I want is to earn something every day,\r\n",
      "if I know how; I'm sure I don't wish to be idle.  If you knew all, you'd\r\n",
      "know I did not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you mean, IF I KNEW ALL?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, I mean, if you knew about Lightfoot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who's Lightfoot?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, mammy's horse,\" added Jem, looking out of the window; \"I must make\r\n",
      "haste home, and feed him afore it gets dark; he'll wonder what's gone\r\n",
      "with me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let him wonder a few minutes longer,\" said the lady, \"and tell me the\r\n",
      "rest of your story.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've no story, ma'am, to tell, but as how mammy says he must go to the\r\n",
      "fair Monday fortnight, to be sold, if she can't get the two guineas for\r\n",
      "her rent; and I should be main sorry to part with him, for I love him,\r\n",
      "and he loves me; so I'll work for him, I will, all I can.  To be sure, as\r\n",
      "mammy says, I have no chance, such a little fellow as I am, of earning\r\n",
      "two guineas afore Monday fortnight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But are you willing earnestly to work?\" said the lady; \"you know there\r\n",
      "is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones, and\r\n",
      "working steadily every day, and all day long.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" said Jem, \"I would work every day, and all day long.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then,\" said the lady, \"I will give you work.  Come here, to-morrow\r\n",
      "morning, and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies, and I will\r\n",
      "pay you sixpence a day.  Remember, you must be at the gates by six\r\n",
      "o'clock.\"  Jem bowed, thanked her, and went away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was late in the evening, and Jem was impatient to get home to feed\r\n",
      "Lightfoot; yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had\r\n",
      "trusted him to sell the fossils, that he would bring him half of what he\r\n",
      "got for them; so he thought that he had better go to him directly; and\r\n",
      "away he went, running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile,\r\n",
      "till he came to the man's house.  He was just come home from work, and\r\n",
      "was surprised when Jem showed him the half-crown, saying, \"Look what I\r\n",
      "got for the stones; you are to have half, you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said the man, when he had heard his story, \"I shall not take half\r\n",
      "of that; it was given to you.  I expected but a shilling at the most, and\r\n",
      "the half of that is but sixpence, and that I'll take.  Wife, give the lad\r\n",
      "two shillings, and take this half-crown.\"  So the wife opened an old\r\n",
      "glove, and took out two shillings; and the man, as she opened the glove,\r\n",
      "put in his fingers, and took out a little silver penny.  \"There, he shall\r\n",
      "have that into the bargain for his honesty--honesty is the best policy--\r\n",
      "there's a lucky penny for you, that I've kept ever since I can remember.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you ever go to part with it, do ye hear!\" cried the woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let him do what he will with it, wife,\" said the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" argued the wife, \"another penny would do just as well to buy\r\n",
      "gingerbread; and that's what it will go for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, that it shall not, I promise you,\" said Jem; and so he ran away\r\n",
      "home, fed Lightfoot, stroked him, went to bed, jumped up at five o'clock\r\n",
      "in the morning, and went singing to work as gay as a lark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four days he worked \"every day and all day long\"; and every evening the\r\n",
      "lady, when she came out to walk in her gardens, looked at his work.  At\r\n",
      "last she said to her gardener, \"This little boy works very hard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never had so good a little boy about the grounds,\" said the gardener;\r\n",
      "\"he's always at his work, let me come by when I will, and he has got\r\n",
      "twice as much done as another would do; yes, twice as much, ma'am; for\r\n",
      "look here--he began at this 'ere rose-bush, and now he's got to where you\r\n",
      "stand, ma'am; and here is the day's work that t'other boy, and he's three\r\n",
      "years older too, did to-day--I say, measure Jem's fairly, and it's twice\r\n",
      "as much, I'm sure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the lady to her gardener, \"show me how much is a fair day's\r\n",
      "work for a boy of his age.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come at six o'clock and go at six? why, about this much, ma'am,\" said\r\n",
      "the gardener, marking off a piece of the border with his spade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then, little boy,\" said the lady, \"so much shall be your task every day.\r\n",
      "The gardener will mark it off for you; and when you've done, the rest of\r\n",
      "the day you may do what you please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem was extremely glad of this; and the next day he had finished his task\r\n",
      "by four o'clock; so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself.\r\n",
      "He was as fond of play as any little boy could be; and when he was at it\r\n",
      "he played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable; so as soon as he\r\n",
      "had finished his task, fed Lightfoot, and put by the sixpence he had\r\n",
      "earned that day, he ran to the playground in the village, where he found\r\n",
      "a party of boys playing, and amongst them Lazy Lawrence, who indeed was\r\n",
      "not playing, but lounging upon a gate, with his thumb in his mouth.  The\r\n",
      "rest were playing at cricket.  Jem joined them, and was the merriest and\r\n",
      "most active amongst them; till, at last, when quite out of breath with\r\n",
      "running, he was obliged to give up to rest himself, and sat down upon the\r\n",
      "stile, close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why don't you play, Lawrence?\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm tired,\" said Lawrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tired of what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know well what tires me; grandmother says I'm ill, and I must\r\n",
      "take something--I don't know what ails me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, pugh! take a good race--one, two, three, and away--and you'll find\r\n",
      "yourself as well as ever.  Come, run--one, two, three, and away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, no, I can't run, indeed,\" said he, hanging back heavily; \"you know I\r\n",
      "can play all day long if I like it, so I don't mind play as you do, who\r\n",
      "have only one hour for it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So much the worse for you.  Come, now, I'm quite fresh again, will you\r\n",
      "have one game at ball? do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I tell you I can't; I'm as tired as if I had been working all day\r\n",
      "long as hard as a horse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ten times more,\" said Jem, \"for I have been working all day long, as\r\n",
      "hard as a horse, and yet you see I'm not a bit tired, only a little out\r\n",
      "of breath just now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's very odd,\" said Lawrence, and yawned, for want of some better\r\n",
      "answer; then taking out a handful of halfpence,--\"See what I got from\r\n",
      "father today, because I asked him just at the right time, when he had\r\n",
      "drunk a glass or two; then I can get anything I want out of him--see! a\r\n",
      "penny, twopence, threepence, fourpence--there's eightpence in all; would\r\n",
      "not you be happy if you had EIGHTPENCE?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, I don't know,\" said Jem, laughing, \"for you don't seem happy, and\r\n",
      "you HAVE EIGHTPENCE.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That does not signify, though.  I'm sure you only say that because you\r\n",
      "envy me.  You don't know what it is to have eightpence.  You never had\r\n",
      "more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem smiled.  \"Oh, as to that,\" said he, \"you are mistaken, for I have at\r\n",
      "this very time more than twopence, threepence, or eightpence either.  I\r\n",
      "have--let me--see--stones, two shillings; then five days' work--that's\r\n",
      "five sixpences, that's two shillings and sixpence; in all, makes four\r\n",
      "shillings and sixpence; and my silver penny, is four and sevenpence--four\r\n",
      "and sevenpence!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have not!\" said Lawrence, roused so as absolutely to stand upright,\r\n",
      "\"four and sevenpence, have you?  Show it me, and then I'll believe you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Follow me, then,\" cried Jem, \"and I'll soon make you believe me; come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it far?\" said Lawrence, following half-running, half-hobbling, till\r\n",
      "he came to the stable, where Jem showed him his treasure.  \"And how did\r\n",
      "you come by it--honestly?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Honestly! to be sure I did; I earned it all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord bless me, earned it! well, I've a great mind to work; but then it's\r\n",
      "such hot weather, besides, grandmother says I'm not strong enough yet for\r\n",
      "hard work; and besides, I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want\r\n",
      "it, so I need not work.  But four and sevenpence; let's see, what will\r\n",
      "you do with it all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a secret,\" said Jem, looking great.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can guess; I know what I'd do with it if it was mine.  First, I'd buy\r\n",
      "pocketfuls of gingerbread; then I'd buy ever so many apples and nuts.\r\n",
      "Don't you love nuts?  I'd buy nuts enough to last me from this time to\r\n",
      "Christmas, and I'd make little Newton crack 'em for me, for that's the\r\n",
      "worst of nuts; there's the trouble of cracking 'em.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you never deserve to have a nut.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you'll give me some of yours,\" said Lawrence, in a fawning tone; for\r\n",
      "he thought it easier to coax than to work--\"you'll give me some of your\r\n",
      "good things, won't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall not have any of those good things,\" said Jem.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then, what will you do with all your money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I know very well what to do with it; but, as I told you, that's a\r\n",
      "secret, and I sha'n't tell it anybody.  Come now, let's go back and play-\r\n",
      "-their game's up, I daresay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence went back with him, full of curiosity, and out of humour with\r\n",
      "himself and his eightpence.  \"If I had four and sevenpence,\" said he to\r\n",
      "himself, \"I certainly should be happy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day, as usual, Jem jumped up before six o'clock and went to his\r\n",
      "work, whilst Lazy Lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do\r\n",
      "with himself.  In the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his\r\n",
      "money in apples and gingerbread; and as long as these lasted, he found\r\n",
      "himself well received by his companions; but, at length the third day he\r\n",
      "spent his last halfpenny, and when it was gone, unfortunately some nuts\r\n",
      "tempted him very much, but he had no money to pay for them; so he ran\r\n",
      "home to coax his father, as he called it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he got home he heard his father talking very loud, and at first he\r\n",
      "thought he was drunk; but when he opened the kitchen door, he saw that he\r\n",
      "was not drunk, but angry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You lazy dog!\" cried he, turning suddenly upon Lawrence, and gave him\r\n",
      "such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes; \"you\r\n",
      "lazy dog!  See what you've done for me--look!--look, look, I say!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses, and with\r\n",
      "fear, amazement and remorse, beheld at least a dozen bottles burst, and\r\n",
      "the fine Worcestershire cider streaming over the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, did not I order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the\r\n",
      "cellar, and did not I charge you to wire the corks? answer me, you lazy\r\n",
      "rascal; did not I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Lawrence, scratching his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why was not it done, I ask you?\" cried his father, with renewed\r\n",
      "anger, as another bottle burst at the moment.  \"What do you stand there\r\n",
      "for, you lazy brat? why don't you move, I say?  No, no,\" catching hold of\r\n",
      "him, \"I believe you can't move; but I'll make you.\"  And he shook him\r\n",
      "till Lawrence was so giddy he could not stand.  \"What had you to think\r\n",
      "of?  What had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider,\r\n",
      "my Worcestershire cider, to the cellar when I bid you?  But go, you'll\r\n",
      "never be good for anything; you are such a lazy rascal--get out of my\r\n",
      "sight!\"  So saying, he pushed him out of the house door, and Lawrence\r\n",
      "sneaked off, seeing that this was no time to make his petition for\r\n",
      "halfpence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day he saw the nuts again, and wishing for them more than ever,\r\n",
      "he went home, in hopes that his father, as he said to himself, would be\r\n",
      "in a better humour.  But the cider was still fresh in his recollection;\r\n",
      "and the moment Lawrence began to whisper the word \"halfpenny\" in his ear,\r\n",
      "his father swore, with a loud oath, \"I will not give you a halfpenny, no,\r\n",
      "not a farthing, for a month to come.  If you want money, go work for it;\r\n",
      "I've had enough of your laziness--go work!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At these terrible words Lawrence burst into tears, and, going to the side\r\n",
      "of a ditch, sat down and cried for an hour; and when he had cried till he\r\n",
      "could cry no more, he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets, to\r\n",
      "see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left; and, to his\r\n",
      "great joy, in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found.\r\n",
      "With this he proceeded to the fruit woman's stall.  She was busy weighing\r\n",
      "out some plums, so he was obliged to wait; and whilst he was waiting he\r\n",
      "heard some people near him talking and laughing very loud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fruit woman's stall was at the gate of an inn yard; and peeping\r\n",
      "through the gate in this yard, Lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy,\r\n",
      "about his own size, playing at pitch farthing.  He stood by watching them\r\n",
      "for a few minutes.  \"I began but with one halfpenny,\" cried the stable\r\n",
      "boy, with an oath, \"and now I've got twopence!\" added he, jingling the\r\n",
      "halfpence in his waistcoat pocket.  Lawrence was moved at the sound, and\r\n",
      "said to himself, \"If _I_ begin with one halfpenny I may end, like him,\r\n",
      "with having twopence; and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to\r\n",
      "work.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he stepped forward, presenting his halfpenny, offering to toss up with\r\n",
      "the stable boy, who, after looking him full in the face, accepted the\r\n",
      "proposal, and threw his halfpenny into the air.  \"Head or tail?\" cried\r\n",
      "he.  \"Head,\" replied Lawrence, and it came up head.  He seized the penny,\r\n",
      "surprised at his own success, and would have gone instantly to have laid\r\n",
      "it out in nuts; but the stable boy stopped him, and tempted him to throw\r\n",
      "again.  This time Lawrence lost; he threw again and won; and so he went\r\n",
      "on, sometimes losing, but most frequently winning, till half the morning\r\n",
      "was lost.  At last, however, finding himself the master of three\r\n",
      "halfpence, said he would play no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stable boy, grumbling, swore he would have his revenge another time,\r\n",
      "and Lawrence went and bought his nuts.  \"It is a good thing,\" said he to\r\n",
      "himself, \"to play at pitch farthing; the next time I want a halfpenny\r\n",
      "I'll not ask my father for it, nor go to work neither.\"  Satisfied with\r\n",
      "this resolution, he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure, upon the\r\n",
      "horse block in the inn yard.  Here, whilst he ate, he overheard the\r\n",
      "conversation of the stable boys and postilions.  At first their shocking\r\n",
      "oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him; for Lawrence, though\r\n",
      "lazy, had not yet learned to be a wicked boy.  But, by degrees, he was\r\n",
      "accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling, and took a delight and\r\n",
      "interest in their disputes and battles.  As this was an amusement which\r\n",
      "he could enjoy without any sort of exertion, he soon grew so fond of it,\r\n",
      "that every day he returned to the stable yard, and the horse block became\r\n",
      "his constant seat.  Here he found some relief from the insupportable\r\n",
      "fatigue of doing nothing, and here, hour after hour, with his elbows on\r\n",
      "his knees, and his head on his hands, he sat, the spectator of\r\n",
      "wickedness.  Gaming, cheating and lying soon became familiar to him; and,\r\n",
      "to complete his ruin, he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the\r\n",
      "stable boy a very bad boy with whom he had first begun to game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see.  But it is now\r\n",
      "time to inquire what little Jem had been doing all this while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, after Jem had finished his task, the gardener asked him to stay\r\n",
      "a little while, to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall.\r\n",
      "Jem, always active and obliging, readily stayed from play, and was\r\n",
      "carrying in a heavy flower pot, when his mistress crossed the hall.\r\n",
      "\"What a terrible litter!\" said she, \"you are making here--why don't you\r\n",
      "wipe your shoes upon the mat?\"  Jem turned to look for the mat, but he\r\n",
      "saw none.  \"Oh,\" said the lady recollecting herself, \"I can't blame you,\r\n",
      "for there is no mat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, ma'am,\" said the gardener, \"nor I don't know when, if ever, the man\r\n",
      "will bring home those mats you bespoke, ma'am.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am very sorry to hear that,\" said the lady; \"I wish we could find\r\n",
      "somebody who would do them, if he can't.  I should not care what sort of\r\n",
      "mats they were, so that one could wipe one's feet on them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem, as he was sweeping away the litter, when he heard these last words,\r\n",
      "said to himself, \"Perhaps I could make a mat.\"  And all the way home, as\r\n",
      "he trudged along whistling, he was thinking over a scheme for making\r\n",
      "mats, which, however bold it may appear, he did not despair of executing,\r\n",
      "with patience and industry.  Many were the difficulties which his\r\n",
      "\"prophetic eye\" foresaw; but he felt within himself that spirit which\r\n",
      "spurs men on to great enterprises, and makes them \"trample on\r\n",
      "impossibilities.\"  In the first place, he recollected that he had seen\r\n",
      "Lazy Lawrence, whilst he lounged upon the gate, twist a bit of heath into\r\n",
      "different shapes; and he thought, that if he could find some way of\r\n",
      "plaiting heath firmly together, it would make a very pretty green soft\r\n",
      "mat, which would do very well for one to wipe one's shoes on.  About a\r\n",
      "mile from his mother's house, on the common which Jem rode over when he\r\n",
      "went to Farmer Truck's for the giant strawberries, he remembered to have\r\n",
      "seen a great quantity of this heath; and, as it was now only six o'clock\r\n",
      "in the evening, he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot,\r\n",
      "stroke him, go to the common, return, and make one trial of his skill\r\n",
      "before he went to bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common, and there Jem gathered as\r\n",
      "much of the heath as he thought he should want.  But what toil! what\r\n",
      "time! what pains did it cost him, before he could make anything like a\r\n",
      "mat!  Twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath, and give up his\r\n",
      "project, from impatience of repeated disappointments.  But still he\r\n",
      "persevered.  Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and\r\n",
      "time.  Two hours he worked before he went to bed.  All his play hours the\r\n",
      "next day he spent at his mat; which, in all, made five hours of fruitless\r\n",
      "attempts.  The sixth, however, repaid him for the labours of the other\r\n",
      "five.  He conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath\r\n",
      "substantially together, and at length completely finished a mat, which\r\n",
      "far surpassed his most sanguine expectations.  He was extremely happy--\r\n",
      "sang, danced round it--whistled--looked at it again and again, and could\r\n",
      "hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed.  He laid it\r\n",
      "by his bedside, that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress.  She\r\n",
      "looked fully as much surprised as he expected, when she saw it, and when\r\n",
      "she heard who made it.  After having duly admired it, she asked how much\r\n",
      "he expected for his mat.  \"Expect!--Nothing, ma'am,\" said Jem; \"I meant\r\n",
      "to give it you, if you'd have it; I did not mean to sell it.  I made it\r\n",
      "in my play hours, I was very happy in making it; and I'm very glad, too,\r\n",
      "that you like it; and if you please to keep it, ma'am, that's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But that's not all,\" said the lady.  \"Spend your time no more in weeding\r\n",
      "in my garden, you can employ yourself much better; you shall have the\r\n",
      "reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry.  Make as many more\r\n",
      "such mats as you can, and I will take care and dispose of them for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank'e, ma'am,\" said Jem, making his best bow, for he thought by the\r\n",
      "lady's looks that she meant to do him a favour, though he repeated to\r\n",
      "himself, \"Dispose of them, what does that mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day he went to work to make more mats, and he soon learned to\r\n",
      "make them so well and quickly, that he was surprised at his own success.\r\n",
      "In every one he made he found less difficulty, so that, instead of making\r\n",
      "two, he could soon make four in a day.  In a fortnight he made eighteen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Saturday night when he finished, and he carried, at three\r\n",
      "journeys, his eighteen mats to his mistress' house; piled them all up in\r\n",
      "the hall, and stood with his hat off, with a look of proud humility,\r\n",
      "beside the pile, waiting for his mistress' appearance.  Presently a\r\n",
      "folding-door, at one end of the hall, opened, and he saw his mistress,\r\n",
      "with a great many gentlemen and ladies, rising from several tables.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! there is my little boy and his mats,\" cried the lady; and, followed\r\n",
      "by all the rest of the company, she came into the hall.  Jem modestly\r\n",
      "retired whilst they looked at his mats; but in a minute or two his\r\n",
      "mistress beckoned to him, and when he came into the middle of the circle,\r\n",
      "he saw that his pile of mats had disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the lady, smiling, \"what do you see that makes you look so\r\n",
      "surprised?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That all my mats are gone,\" said Jem; \"but you are very welcome.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are we?\" said the lady, \"well, take up your hat and go home then, for\r\n",
      "you see that it is getting late, and you know Lightfoot will wonder\r\n",
      "what's become of you.\"  Jem turned round to take up his hat, which he had\r\n",
      "left on the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But how his countenance changed! the hat was heavy with shillings.\r\n",
      "Everyone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings; so that for the\r\n",
      "eighteen mats he had got thirty-six shillings.  \"Thirty-six shillings,\"\r\n",
      "said the lady; \"five and sevenpence I think you told me you had earned\r\n",
      "already--how much does that make?  I must add, I believe, one other\r\n",
      "sixpence to make out your two guineas.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Two guineas!\" exclaimed Jem, now quite conquering his bashfulness, for\r\n",
      "at the moment he forgot where he was, and saw nobody that was by.  \"Two\r\n",
      "guineas!\" cried he, clapping his hands together,--\"O, Lightfoot!  O,\r\n",
      "mother!\"  Then, recollecting himself, he saw his mistress, whom he now\r\n",
      "looked up to quite as a friend.  \"Will YOU thank them all?\" said he,\r\n",
      "scarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company; \"will YOU\r\n",
      "thank 'em, for you know I don't know how to thank 'em RIGHTLY.\"\r\n",
      "Everybody thought, however, that they had been thanked RIGHTLY.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now we won't keep you any longer, only,\" said his mistress, \"I have one\r\n",
      "thing to ask you, that I may be by when you show your treasure to your\r\n",
      "mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" said Jem, \"come with me now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not now,\" said the lady, laughing; \"but I will come to Ashton to-morrow\r\n",
      "evening; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That she will,\" said Jem:  \"I'll search the garden myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He now went home, but felt it a great restraint to wait till to-morrow\r\n",
      "evening before he told his mother.  To console himself he flew to the\r\n",
      "stable:--\"Lightfoot, you're not to be sold on Monday, poor fellow!\" said\r\n",
      "he, patting him, and then could not refrain from counting out his money.\r\n",
      "Whilst he was intent upon this, Jem was startled by a noise at the door:\r\n",
      "somebody was trying to pull up the latch.  It opened, and there came in\r\n",
      "Lazy Lawrence, with a boy in a red jacket, who had a cock under his arm.\r\n",
      "They started when they got into the middle of the stable, and when they\r\n",
      "saw Jem, who had been at first hidden by the horse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We--we--we came,\" stammered Lazy Lawrence--\"I mean, I came to--to--to--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To ask you,\" continued the stable-boy, in a bold tone, \"whether you will\r\n",
      "go with us to the cock-fight on Monday?  See, I've a fine cock here, and\r\n",
      "Lawrence told me you were a great friend of his; so I came.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of\r\n",
      "cock-fighting and in recommendation of his new companion.  But Jem looked\r\n",
      "at the stable-boy with dislike, and a sort of dread.  Then turning his\r\n",
      "eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion, said, in a low voice, to\r\n",
      "Lawrence, \"Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Lawrence, \"as to that; but they say a cockfight's a\r\n",
      "fine sight, and it's no more cruel in me to go than another; and a great\r\n",
      "many go, and I've nothing else to do, so I shall go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I have something else to do,\" said Jem, laughing, \"so I shall not\r\n",
      "go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" continued Lawrence, \"you know Monday is the great Bristol fair,\r\n",
      "and one must be merry then, of all the days in the year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One day in the year, sure, there's no harm in being merry,\" said the\r\n",
      "stable boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope not,\" said Jem; \"for I know for my part, I am merry every day in\r\n",
      "the year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's very odd,\" said Lawrence; \"but I know for my part, I would not\r\n",
      "for all the world miss going to the fair, for at least it will be\r\n",
      "something to talk of for half a year after.  Come, you'll go, won't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said Jem, still looking as if he did not like to talk before the\r\n",
      "ill-looking stranger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then what will you do with all your money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll tell you about that another time,\" whispered Jem; \"and don't you go\r\n",
      "to see that cock's eyes pecked out; it won't make you merry, I'm sure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I had anything else to divert me,\" said Lawrence, hesitating and\r\n",
      "yawning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come,\" cried the stable boy, seizing his stretching arm, \"come along,\"\r\n",
      "cried he; and, pulling him away from Jem, upon whom he cast a look of\r\n",
      "extreme contempt; \"leave him alone, he's not the sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a fool you are,\" said he to Lawrence, the moment he got him out of\r\n",
      "the stable; \"you might have known he would not go, else we should soon\r\n",
      "have trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence.  But how came you to\r\n",
      "talk of four and sevenpence.  I saw in the manger a hat full of silver.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Lawrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed; but why did you stammer so when we first got in?  You had\r\n",
      "liked to have blown us all up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was so ashamed,\" said Lawrence, hanging down his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ashamed! but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it, and I\r\n",
      "sha'n't let you off; you owe us half a crown, recollect, and I must be\r\n",
      "paid to-night, so see and get the money somehow or other.\"  After a\r\n",
      "considerable pause he added, \"I answer for it he'd never miss half a\r\n",
      "crown out of all that silver.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But to steal,\" said Lawrence, drawing back with horror, \"I never thought\r\n",
      "I should come to that--and from poor Jem, too--the money that he has\r\n",
      "worked so hard for, too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it is not stealing; we don't mean to steal; only to borrow it; and\r\n",
      "if we win, which we certainly shall, at the cock-fight, pay it back\r\n",
      "again, and he'll never know anything about the matter, and what harm will\r\n",
      "it do him?  Besides, what signifies talking, you can't go to the cock-\r\n",
      "fight, or the fair either, if you don't; and I tell ye we don't mean to\r\n",
      "steal it; we'll pay it by Monday night.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence made no reply, and they parted without his coming to any\r\n",
      "determination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here let us pause in our story.  We are almost afraid to go on.  The rest\r\n",
      "is very shocking.  Our little readers will shudder as they read.  But it\r\n",
      "is better that they should know the truth, and see what the idle boy came\r\n",
      "to at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the dead of the night, Lawrence heard somebody tap at his window.  He\r\n",
      "knew well who it was, for this was the signal agreed upon between him and\r\n",
      "his wicked companion.  He trembled at the thoughts of what he was about\r\n",
      "to do, and lay quite still, with his head under the bedclothes, till he\r\n",
      "heard the second tap.  Then he got up, dressed himself, and opened his\r\n",
      "window.  It was almost even with the ground.  His companion said to him,\r\n",
      "in a hollow voice, \"Are you ready?\"  He made no answer, but got out of\r\n",
      "the window and followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon,\r\n",
      "and it was quite dark.  \"Where are you?\" whispered Lawrence, groping\r\n",
      "about, \"where are you?  Speak to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am here; give me your hand.\"  Lawrence stretched out his hand.  \"Is\r\n",
      "that your hand?\" said the wicked boy, as Lawrence laid hold of him; \"how\r\n",
      "cold it feels.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us go back,\" said Lawrence; \"it is time yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is no time to go back,\" replied the other, opening the door; \"you've\r\n",
      "gone too far now to go back,\" and he pushed Lawrence into the stable.\r\n",
      "\"Have you found it?  Take care of the horse.  Have you done?  What are\r\n",
      "you about?  Make haste, I hear a noise,\" said the stable boy, who watched\r\n",
      "at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am feeling for the half-crown, but I can't find it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bring all together.\"  He brought Jem's broken flower pot, with all the\r\n",
      "money in it, to the door.  The black cloud had now passed over the moon,\r\n",
      "and the light shone full upon them.  \"What do we stand here for?\" said\r\n",
      "the stable boy, snatching the flower-pot out of Lawrence's trembling\r\n",
      "hands, and pulled him away from the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good God!\" cried Lawrence, \"you won't take all.  You said you'd only\r\n",
      "take half a crown, and pay it back on Monday.  You said you'd only take\r\n",
      "half a crown!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hold your tongue,\" replied the other, walking on, deaf to all\r\n",
      "remonstrances--\"if ever I am to be hanged, it sha'n't be for half a\r\n",
      "crown.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence's blood ran cold in his veins, and he felt as if all his hair\r\n",
      "stood on end.  Not another word passed.  His accomplice carried off the\r\n",
      "money, and Lawrence crept, with all the horrors of guilt upon him, to his\r\n",
      "restless bed.  All night he was starting from frightful dreams; or else,\r\n",
      "broad awake, he lay listening to every small noise, unable to stir, and\r\n",
      "scarcely daring to breathe--tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds\r\n",
      "of fear, that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought the morning would never come; but when it was day, when he\r\n",
      "heard the birds sing, and saw everything look cheerful as usual, he felt\r\n",
      "still more miserable.  It was Sunday morning, and the bell rang for\r\n",
      "church.  All the children of the village, dressed in their Sunday\r\n",
      "clothes, innocent and gay, and little Jem, the best and gayest amongst\r\n",
      "them, went flocking by his door to church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Lawrence,\" said Jem, pulling his coat as he passed and saw\r\n",
      "Lawrence leaning against his father's door, \"what makes you look so\r\n",
      "black?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I?\" said Lawrence, starting; \"why do you say that I look black?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nay, then,\" said Jem, \"you look white enough now, if that will please\r\n",
      "you, for you're turned as pale as death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pale?\" replied Lawrence, not knowing what he said, and turned abruptly\r\n",
      "away, for he dared not stand another look of Jem's; conscious that guilt\r\n",
      "was written in his face, he shunned every eye.  He would now have given\r\n",
      "the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind.\r\n",
      "He longed to follow Jem, to fall upon his knees and confess all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dreading the moment when Jem should discover his loss, Lawrence dared not\r\n",
      "stay at home, and not knowing what to do, or where to go, he mechanically\r\n",
      "went to his old haunt at the stable yard, and lurked thereabouts all day\r\n",
      "with his accomplice, who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his\r\n",
      "spirits by talking of the next day's cock-fight.  It was agreed that as\r\n",
      "soon as the dusk of the evening came on, they should go together into a\r\n",
      "certain lonely field, and there divide their booty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the meantime, Jem, when he returned from church, was very full of\r\n",
      "business, preparing for the reception of his mistress, of whose intended\r\n",
      "visit he had informed his mother; and whilst she was arranging the\r\n",
      "kitchen and their little parlour, he ran to search the strawberry beds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, my Jem, how merry you are to-day!\" said his mother, when he came in\r\n",
      "with the strawberries, and was jumping about the room playfully.  \"Now,\r\n",
      "keep those spirits of yours, Jem, till you want 'em, and don't let it\r\n",
      "come upon you all at once.  Have it in mind that to-morrow's fair day,\r\n",
      "and Lightfoot must go.  I bid Farmer Truck call for him to-night.  He\r\n",
      "said he'd take him along with his own, and he'll be here just now--and\r\n",
      "then I know how it will be with you, Jem!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So do I!\" cried Jem, swallowing his secret with great difficulty, and\r\n",
      "then tumbling head over heels four times running.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A carriage passed the window, and stopped at the door.  Jem ran out; it\r\n",
      "was his mistress.  She came in smiling, and soon made the old woman\r\n",
      "smile, too, by praising the neatness of everything in the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We shall pass over, however important as they were deemed at the time,\r\n",
      "the praises of the strawberries, and of \"my grandmother's china plate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another knock was heard at the door.  \"Run, Jem,\" said his mother.  \"I\r\n",
      "hope it's our milk-woman with cream for the lady.\"  No; it was Farmer\r\n",
      "Truck come for Lightfoot.  The old woman's countenance fell.  \"Fetch him\r\n",
      "out, dear,\" said she, turning to her son; but Jem was gone; he flew out\r\n",
      "to the stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck's great-coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sit ye down, farmer,\" said the old woman, after they had waited about\r\n",
      "five minutes in expectation of Jem's return.  \"You'd best sit down, if\r\n",
      "the lady will give you leave; for he'll not hurry himself back again.  My\r\n",
      "boy's a fool, madam, about that there horse.\"  Trying to laugh, she\r\n",
      "added, \"I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part.  He\r\n",
      "won't bring him out till the last minute; so do sit ye down, neighbour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem, with a pale, wild countenance\r\n",
      "came back.  \"What's the matter?\" said his mistress.  \"God bless the boy!\"\r\n",
      "said his mother, looking at him quite frightened, whilst he tried to\r\n",
      "speak, but could not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went up to him, and then leaning his head against her, he cried,\r\n",
      "\"It's gone!--it's all gone!\" and, bursting into tears, he sobbed as if\r\n",
      "his little heart would break.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's gone, love?\" said his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My two guineas--Lightfoot's two guineas.  I went to fetch 'em to give\r\n",
      "you, mammy; but the broken flower-pot that I put them in, and all's\r\n",
      "gone!--quite gone!\" repeated he, checking his sobs.  \"I saw them safe\r\n",
      "last night, and was showing 'em to Lightfoot; and I was so glad to think\r\n",
      "I had earned them all myself; and I thought how surprised you'd look, and\r\n",
      "how glad you'd be, and how you'd kiss me, and all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His mother listened to him with the greatest surprise, whilst his\r\n",
      "mistress stood in silence, looking first at the old woman, and then at\r\n",
      "Jem with a penetrating eye, as if she suspected the truth of his story,\r\n",
      "and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is a very strange thing!\" said she, gravely.  \"How came you to\r\n",
      "leave all your money in a broken flower-pot in the stable?  How came you\r\n",
      "not to give it to your mother to take care of?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, don't you remember?\" said Jem, looking up, in the midst of his\r\n",
      "tears--\"why, don't you remember you, your own self, bid me not tell her\r\n",
      "about it till you were by?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And did you not tell her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nay, ask mammy,\" said Jem, a little offended; and when afterwards the\r\n",
      "lady went on questioning him in a severe manner, as if she did not\r\n",
      "believe him, he at last made no answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, Jem! Jem! why don't you speak to the lady?\" said his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have spoke, and spoke the truth,\" said Jem, proudly; \"and she did not\r\n",
      "believe me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still the lady, who had lived too long in the world to be without\r\n",
      "suspicion, maintained a cold manner, and determined to wait the event\r\n",
      "without interfering, saying only, that she hoped the money would be\r\n",
      "found, and advised Jem to have done crying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have done,\" said Jem; \"I shall cry no more.\"  And as he had the\r\n",
      "greatest command over himself, he actually did not shed another tear, not\r\n",
      "even when the farmer got up to go, saying, he could wait no longer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem silently went to bring out Lightfoot.  The lady now took her seat,\r\n",
      "where she could see all that passed at the open parlour-window.  The old\r\n",
      "woman stood at the door, and several idle people of the village, who had\r\n",
      "gathered round the lady's carriage examining it, turned about to listen.\r\n",
      "In a minute or two Jem appeared, with a steady countenance, leading\r\n",
      "Lightfoot and, when he came up, without saying a word, put the bridle\r\n",
      "into Farmer Truck's hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He HAS BEEN a good horse,\" said the farmer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He IS a good horse!\" cried Jem, and threw his arm over Lightfoot's neck,\r\n",
      "hiding his own face as he leaned upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this instant a party of milk-women went by; and one of them, having\r\n",
      "set down her pail, came behind Jem, and gave him a pretty smart blow upon\r\n",
      "the back.  He looked up.  \"And don't you know me?\" said she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I forget,\" said Jem; \"I think I have seen your face before, but I\r\n",
      "forget.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you so? and you'll tell me just now,\" said she, half opening her\r\n",
      "hand, \"that you forget who gave you this, and who charged you not to part\r\n",
      "with it, too.\"  Here she quite opened her large hand, and on the palm of\r\n",
      "it appeared Jem's silver penny.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where?\" exclaimed Jem, seizing it, \"oh, where did you find it? and have\r\n",
      "you--oh, tell me, have you got the rest of my money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know nothing of your money--I don't know what you would be at,\" said\r\n",
      "the milk-woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But where--pray tell me where--did you find this?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With them that you gave it to, I suppose,\" said the milk-woman, turning\r\n",
      "away suddenly to take up her milk-pail.  But now Jem's mistress called to\r\n",
      "her through the window, begging her to stop, and joining in his\r\n",
      "entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, madam,\" said she, taking up the corner of her apron, \"I came by it\r\n",
      "in an odd way, too.  You must know my Betty is sick, so I came with the\r\n",
      "milk myself, though it's not what I'm used to; for my Betty--you know my\r\n",
      "Betty?\" said she, turning round to the old woman, \"my Betty serves you,\r\n",
      "and she's a tight and stirring lassy, ma'am, I can assure--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I don't doubt it,\" said the lady, impatiently; \"but about the\r\n",
      "silver penny?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, that's true; as I was coming along all alone, for the rest came\r\n",
      "round, and I came a short cut across yon field--no, you can't see it,\r\n",
      "madam, where you stand--but if you were here--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see it--I know it,\" said Jem, out of breath with anxiety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--well--I rested my pail upon the stile, and sets me down awhile,\r\n",
      "and there comes out of the hedge--I don't know well how, for they\r\n",
      "startled me so I'd liked to have thrown down my milk--two boys, one about\r\n",
      "the size of he,\" said she pointing to Jem, \"and one a matter taller, but\r\n",
      "ill-looking like; so I did not think to stir to make way for them, and\r\n",
      "they were like in a desperate hurry:  so, without waiting for the stile,\r\n",
      "one of 'em pulled at the gate, and when it would not open for it was\r\n",
      "tied with a pretty stout cord one of 'em whips out with his knife and\r\n",
      "cuts it--  Now, have you a knife about you, sir?\" continued the milk\r\n",
      "woman to the farmer.  He gave her his knife.  \"Here, now, ma'am, just\r\n",
      "sticking, as it were here, between the blade and the haft, was the silver\r\n",
      "penny.  The lad took no notice; but when he opened it, out it falls.\r\n",
      "Still he takes no heed, but cuts the cord, as I said before, and through\r\n",
      "the gate they went, and out of sight in half a minute.  I picks up the\r\n",
      "penny, for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a\r\n",
      "long time, and had given against my voice to he,\" pointing to Jem; \"and I\r\n",
      "charged him not to part with it; and, ma'am, when I looked I knew it by\r\n",
      "the mark, so I thought I would show it to HE,\" again pointing to Jem,\r\n",
      "\"and let him give it back to those it belongs to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It belongs to me,\" said Jem, \"I never gave it to anybody--but--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" cried the farmer, \"those boys have robbed him; it is they who have\r\n",
      "all his money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, which way did they go?\" cried Jem, \"I'll run after them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said the lady, calling to her servant; and she desired him to\r\n",
      "take his horse and ride after them.  \"Ay,\" added Farmer Truck, \"do you\r\n",
      "take the road, and I'll take the field way, and I'll be bound we'll have\r\n",
      "'em presently.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves, the lady, who was now\r\n",
      "thoroughly convinced of Jem's truth, desired her coachman would produce\r\n",
      "what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening.  Out of the boot\r\n",
      "of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and\r\n",
      "bridle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How Jem's eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon Lightfoot's back!\r\n",
      "\"Put it on your horse yourself, Jem,\" said the lady; \"it is yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Confused reports of Lightfoot's splendid accoutrements, of the pursuit of\r\n",
      "thieves, and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at Dame\r\n",
      "Preston's window, quickly spread through the village, and drew everybody\r\n",
      "from their houses.  They crowded round Jem to hear the story.  The\r\n",
      "children especially, who were fond of him, expressed the strongest\r\n",
      "indignation against the thieves.  Every eye was on the stretch; and now\r\n",
      "some, who had run down the lane, came back shouting, \"Here they are!\r\n",
      "they've got the thieves!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The footman on horseback carried one boy before him; and the farmer,\r\n",
      "striding along, dragged another.  The latter had on a red jacket, which\r\n",
      "little Jem immediately recollected, and scarcely dared lift his eyes to\r\n",
      "look at the boy on horseback.  \"Good God!\" said he to himself, \"it must\r\n",
      "be--yet surely it can't be Lawrence!\"  The footman rode on as fast as the\r\n",
      "people would let him.  The boy's hat was slouched, and his head hung\r\n",
      "down, so that nobody could see his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd.  A man who was half\r\n",
      "drunk pushed his way forwards, swearing that nobody should stop him; that\r\n",
      "he had a right to see--and he WOULD see.  And so he did; for, forcing\r\n",
      "through all resistance, he staggered up to the footman just as he was\r\n",
      "lifting down the boy he had carried before him.  \"I WILL--I tell you I\r\n",
      "WILL see the thief!\" cried the drunken man, pushing up the boy's hat.  It\r\n",
      "was his own son.  \"Lawrence!\" exclaimed the wretched father.  The shock\r\n",
      "sobered him at once, and he hid his face in his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was an awful silence.  Lawrence fell on his knees, and in a voice\r\n",
      "that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the\r\n",
      "circumstances of his guilt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Such a young creature so wicked!\" the bystanders exclaimed; \"what could\r\n",
      "put such wickedness in your head?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bad company,\" said Lawrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how came you--what brought you into bad company?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know, except it was idleness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence's pockets;\r\n",
      "and when the money appeared, all his former companions in the village\r\n",
      "looked at each other with astonishment and terror.  Their parents grasped\r\n",
      "their little hands closer, and cried, \"Thank God! he is not my son.  How\r\n",
      "often when he was little we used, as he lounged about, to tell him that\r\n",
      "idleness was the root of all evil.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the hardened wretch, his accomplice, everyone was impatient to\r\n",
      "have him sent to gaol.  He put on a bold, insolent countenance, till he\r\n",
      "heard Lawrence's confession; till the money was found upon him; and he\r\n",
      "heard the milk-woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny\r\n",
      "which he had dropped.  Then he turned pale, and betrayed the strongest\r\n",
      "signs of fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We must take him before the justice,\" said the farmer, \"and he'll be\r\n",
      "lodged in Bristol gaol.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Jem, springing forwards when Lawrence's hands were going to be\r\n",
      "tied, \"let him go--won't you?--can't you let him go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, madam, for mercy's sake,\" said Jem's mother to the lady, \"think\r\n",
      "what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair.  \"It's all\r\n",
      "my fault,\" cried he; \"I brought him up in idleness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But he'll never be idle any more,\" said Jem; \"won't you speak for him,\r\n",
      "ma'am?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't ask the lady to speak for him,\" said the farmer; \"it's better he\r\n",
      "should go to Bridewell now, than to the gallows by-and-by.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing more was said; for everybody felt the truth of the farmer's\r\n",
      "speech.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month, and the stable-boy\r\n",
      "was sent for trial, convicted, and transported to Botany Bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During Lawrence's confinement, Jem often visited him, and carried him\r\n",
      "such little presents as he could afford to give; and Jem could afford to\r\n",
      "be GENEROUS, because he was INDUSTRIOUS.  Lawrence's heart was touched by\r\n",
      "his kindness, and his example struck him so forcibly that, when his\r\n",
      "confinement was ended, he resolved to set immediately to work; and, to\r\n",
      "the astonishment of all who knew him, soon became remarkable for\r\n",
      "industry.  He was found early and late at his work, established a new\r\n",
      "character, and for ever lost the name of \"Lazy Lawrence.\"\r",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Spencer, a very benevolent and sensible man, undertook the education\r\n",
      "of several poor children.  Among the rest was a boy of the name of\r\n",
      "Franklin, whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old.\r\n",
      "Franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character;\r\n",
      "and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child.  When\r\n",
      "any of the neighbours' children quarrelled with him, they used to tell\r\n",
      "him that he would turn out like his father.  But Mr. Spencer always\r\n",
      "assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased; that by\r\n",
      "behaving well he would certainly, sooner or later, secure the esteem and\r\n",
      "love of all who knew him, even of those who had the strongest prejudice\r\n",
      "against him on his father's account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This hope was very delightful to Franklin, and he showed the strongest\r\n",
      "desire to learn and to do everything that was right; so that Mr. Spencer\r\n",
      "soon grew fond of him, and took great pains to instruct him, and to give\r\n",
      "him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful,\r\n",
      "respectable and happy man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he was about thirteen years of age, Mr. Spencer one day sent for him\r\n",
      "into his closet; and as he was folding up a letter which he had been\r\n",
      "writing, said to him, with a very kind look, but in a graver tone than\r\n",
      "usual, \"Franklin, you are going to leave me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir!\" said Franklin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are now going to leave me, and to begin the world for yourself.  You\r\n",
      "will carry this letter to my sister, Mrs. Churchill, in Queen's Square.\r\n",
      "You know Queen's Square?\"  Franklin bowed.  \"You must expect,\" continued\r\n",
      "Mr. Spencer, \"to meet with several disagreeable things, and a great deal\r\n",
      "of rough work, at your first setting out; but be faithful and obedient to\r\n",
      "your mistress, and obliging to your fellow-servants, and all will go\r\n",
      "well.  Mrs. Churchill will make you a very good mistress, if you behave\r\n",
      "properly; and I have no doubt but you will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you will always--I mean, as long as you deserve it--find a friend in\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir--I am sure you are--\"  There Franklin stopped short, for\r\n",
      "the recollection of all Mr. Spencer's goodness rushed upon him at once,\r\n",
      "and he could not say another word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bring me a candle to seal this letter,\" said his master; and he was very\r\n",
      "glad to get out of the room.  He came back with the candle, and, with a\r\n",
      "stout heart, stood by whilst the letter was sealing; and, when his master\r\n",
      "put it into his hand, said, in a cheerful voice, \"I hope you will let me\r\n",
      "see you again, sir, sometimes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly; whenever your mistress can spare you, I shall be very glad to\r\n",
      "see you; and remember, if ever you get into any difficulty, don't be\r\n",
      "afraid to come to me.  I have sometimes spoken harshly to you; but you\r\n",
      "will not meet with a more indulgent friend.\"  Franklin at this turned\r\n",
      "away with a full heart; and, after making two or three attempts to\r\n",
      "express his gratitude, left the room without being able to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got to Queen's Square about three o'clock.  The door was opened by a\r\n",
      "large, red-faced man, in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat, to whom he\r\n",
      "felt afraid to give his message, lest he should not be a servant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what's your business, sir?\" said the butler.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have a letter for Mrs. Churchill, sir,\" said Franklin, endeavouring to\r\n",
      "pronounce his \"sir\" in a tone as respectful as the butler's was insolent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man having examined the direction, seal, and edges of the letter,\r\n",
      "carried it upstairs, and in a few minutes returned, and ordered Franklin\r\n",
      "to rub his shoes well and follow him.  He was then shown into a handsome\r\n",
      "room, where he found his mistress--an elderly lady.  She asked him a few\r\n",
      "questions, examining him attentively as she spoke; and her severe eye at\r\n",
      "first, and her gracious smile afterwards, made him feel that she was a\r\n",
      "person to be both loved and feared.  \"I shall give you in charge,\" said\r\n",
      "she, ringing a bell, \"to my housekeeper, and I hope she will have no\r\n",
      "reason to be displeased with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The housekeeper, when she first came in, appeared with a smiling\r\n",
      "countenance; but the moment she cast her eyes on Franklin, it changed to\r\n",
      "a look of surprise and suspicion.  Her mistress recommended him to her\r\n",
      "protection, saying, \"Pomfret, I hope you will keep this boy under your\r\n",
      "own eye.\"  And she received him with a cold \"Very well, ma'am,\" which\r\n",
      "plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him.  In fact, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Pomfret was a woman so fond of power, and so jealous of favour, that she\r\n",
      "would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress\r\n",
      "without her introduction.  She smothered her displeasure, however, till\r\n",
      "night; when, as she attended her mistress' toilette, she could not\r\n",
      "refrain from expressing her sentiments.  She began cautiously:  \"Ma'am,\r\n",
      "is not this the boy Mr. Spencer was talking of one day--that has been\r\n",
      "brought up by the VILLAINTROPIC SOCIETY, I think they call it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Philanthropic Society; yes,\" said her mistress; \"and my brother gives\r\n",
      "him a high character:  I hope he will do very well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I hope so too,\" observed Mrs. Pomfret; \"but I can't say; for my\r\n",
      "part, I've no great notion of those low people.  They say all those\r\n",
      "children are taken from the very lowest DRUGS and REFUGES of the town,\r\n",
      "and surely they are like enough, ma'am, to take after their own fathers\r\n",
      "and mothers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But they are not suffered to be with their parents,\" rejoined the lady;\r\n",
      "\"and therefore cannot be hurt by their example.  This little boy, to be\r\n",
      "sure, was unfortunate in his father, but he has had an excellent\r\n",
      "education.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, EDICATION! to be sure, ma'am, I know.  I don't say but what\r\n",
      "edication is a great thing.  But then, ma'am, edication can't change the\r\n",
      "NATUR that's in one, they say; and one's that born naturally bad and low,\r\n",
      "they say, all the edication in the world won't do no good; and, for my\r\n",
      "part, ma'am, I know you knows best; but I should be afraid to let any of\r\n",
      "those Villaintropic folks get into my house; for nobody can tell the\r\n",
      "natur of them aforehand.  I declare it frights me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pomfret, I thought you had better sense:  how would this poor boy earn\r\n",
      "his bread? he would be forced to starve or steal, if everybody had such\r\n",
      "prejudices.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pomfret, who really was a good woman, was softened at this idea, and\r\n",
      "said, \"God forbid he should starve or steal, and God forbid I should say\r\n",
      "anything PREJUDICIARY of the boy; for there may be no harm in him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Churchill, changing her tone, \"but, Pomfret, if we\r\n",
      "don't like the boy at the end of the month, we have done with him; for I\r\n",
      "have only promised Mr. Spencer to keep him a month upon trial:  there is\r\n",
      "no harm done.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear, no, ma'am, to be sure; and cook must put up with her\r\n",
      "disappointment, that's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What disappointment?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About her nephew, ma'am; the boy she and I was speaking to you for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The day you called her up about the almond pudding, ma'am.  If you\r\n",
      "remember, you said you should have no objections to try the boy; and upon\r\n",
      "that cook bought him new shirts; but they are to the good, as I tell\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I did not promise to take her nephew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"O, no ma'am, not at all; she does not think to SAY THAT, else I should\r\n",
      "be very angry; but the poor woman never let fall a word, any more than\r\n",
      "frets that the boy should miss such a good place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, but since I did say that I should have no objection to try him, I\r\n",
      "shall keep my word; let him come to-morrow.  Let them both have a fair\r\n",
      "trial, and at the end of the month I can decide which I like best, and\r\n",
      "which we had better keep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dismissed with these orders, Mrs. Pomfret hastened to report all that had\r\n",
      "passed to the cook, like a favourite minister, proud to display the\r\n",
      "extent of her secret influence.  In the morning Felix, the cook's nephew,\r\n",
      "arrived; and, the moment he came into the kitchen, every eye, even the\r\n",
      "scullion's, was fixed upon him with approbation, and afterwards glanced\r\n",
      "upon Franklin with contempt--contempt which Franklin could not endure\r\n",
      "without some confusion, though quite unconscious of having deserved it;\r\n",
      "nor, upon the most impartial and cool self-examination, could he\r\n",
      "comprehend the justice of his judges.  He perceived indeed--for the\r\n",
      "comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers--that\r\n",
      "Felix was a much handsomer, or as the kitchen maid expressed it, a much\r\n",
      "more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was; and\r\n",
      "he was made to understand, that he wanted a frill to his shirt, a cravat,\r\n",
      "a pair of thin shoes, and, above all, shoe strings, besides other\r\n",
      "nameless advantages, which justly made his rival the admiration of the\r\n",
      "kitchen.  However, upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr. Spencer\r\n",
      "had ever said to him, he could not recollect his having warned him that\r\n",
      "shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good\r\n",
      "servant; so that he could only comfort himself with resolving, if\r\n",
      "possible, to make amends for these deficiencies, and to dissipate the\r\n",
      "prejudices which he saw were formed against him, by the strictest\r\n",
      "adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty.  He hoped\r\n",
      "to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all\r\n",
      "her commands, and faithful care of all that belonged to her.  At the same\r\n",
      "time he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow\r\n",
      "servants by showing a constant desire to oblige them.  He pursued this\r\n",
      "plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks, and found that he\r\n",
      "succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress; but\r\n",
      "unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants,\r\n",
      "and he sometimes offended when he least expected it.  He had made great\r\n",
      "progress in the affections of Corkscrew, the butler, by working indeed\r\n",
      "very hard for him, and doing every day at least half his business.  But\r\n",
      "one unfortunate night the butler was gone out; the bell rang:  he went\r\n",
      "upstairs; and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was, he answered that\r\n",
      "he was gone out.  \"Where to!\" said his mistress.  \"I don't know,\"\r\n",
      "answered Franklin.  And, as he had told exactly the truth, and meant to\r\n",
      "do no harm, he was surprised, at the butler's return, when he repeated to\r\n",
      "him what had passed, at receiving a sudden box on the ear, and the\r\n",
      "appellation of a mischievous, impertinent, mean-spirited brat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mischievous, impertinent, mean!\" repeated Franklin to himself; but,\r\n",
      "looking in the butler's face, which was a deeper scarlet than usual, he\r\n",
      "judged that he was far from sober, and did not doubt but that the next\r\n",
      "morning, when he came to the use of his reason, he would be sensible of\r\n",
      "his injustice, and apologize for his box of the ear.  But no apology\r\n",
      "coming all day, Franklin at last ventured to request an explanation, or\r\n",
      "rather, to ask what he had best do on the next occasion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Corkscrew, \"when mistress asked for me, how came you to say I\r\n",
      "was gone out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because, you know, I saw you go out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And when she asked you where I was gone, how came you to say that you\r\n",
      "did not know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because, indeed, I did not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are a stupid blockhead! could you not say I was gone to the\r\n",
      "washerwoman's?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But WERE you?\" said Franklin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Was I?\" cried Corkscrew, and looked as if he would have struck him\r\n",
      "again; \"how dare you give me the lie, Mr. Hypocrite?  You would be ready\r\n",
      "enough, I'll be bound, to make excuses for yourself.  Why are not\r\n",
      "mistress' clogs cleaned?  Go along and blacken 'em, this minute, and send\r\n",
      "Felix to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the butler's\r\n",
      "pantry.  Felix became the favourite of Corkscrew; and, though Franklin by\r\n",
      "no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences,\r\n",
      "nor ever entered without knocking at the door, yet it was his fate once\r\n",
      "to be sent of a message at an unlucky time; and, as the door was half\r\n",
      "open, he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor,\r\n",
      "which he could not help suspecting to be wine; and, as the decanter,\r\n",
      "which usually went upstairs after dinner, was at this time in the\r\n",
      "butler's grasp, without any stopper in it, he was involuntarily forced to\r\n",
      "suspect they were drinking his mistress' wine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which Felix\r\n",
      "received:  his aunt, the cook, had occasion for his assistance, and she\r\n",
      "had many delicious douceurs in her gift.  Many a handful of currants,\r\n",
      "many a half-custard, many a triangular remnant of pie, besides the choice\r\n",
      "of his own meal at breakfast, dinner and supper, fell to the share of the\r\n",
      "favourite Felix; whilst Franklin was neglected, though he took the utmost\r\n",
      "pains to please the cook in all honourable service, and, when she was\r\n",
      "hot, angry, or hurried, he was always at hand to help her; and in the\r\n",
      "hour of adversity, when the clock struck five, and no dinner was dished,\r\n",
      "and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had, Franklin\r\n",
      "would answer to her call, with flowers to garnish her dishes, and\r\n",
      "presence of mind to know, in the midst of the commotion, where everything\r\n",
      "that was wanting was to be found; so that, quick as lightning, all\r\n",
      "difficulties vanished before him.  Yet when the danger was over, and the\r\n",
      "hour of adversity had past, the ungrateful cook would forget her\r\n",
      "benefactor, and, when it came to his supper time, would throw him, with a\r\n",
      "carelessness that touched him sensibly, anything which the other servants\r\n",
      "were too nice to eat.  All this Franklin bore with fortitude; nor did he\r\n",
      "envy Felix the dainties which he ate, sometimes close beside him:  \"For,\"\r\n",
      "said he to himself, \"I have a clear conscience, and that is more than\r\n",
      "Felix can have.  I know how he wins cook's favour too well, and I fancy I\r\n",
      "know how I have offended her; for since the day I saw the basket, she has\r\n",
      "done nothing but huff me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The history of the basket was this.  Mrs. Pomfret, the housekeeper, had\r\n",
      "several times, directly and indirectly, given the world below to\r\n",
      "understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious\r\n",
      "quantity of meat eaten of late.  Now, when she spoke, it was usually at\r\n",
      "dinner time; she always looked, or Franklin imagined that she looked,\r\n",
      "suspiciously at him.  Other people looked more maliciously; but, as he\r\n",
      "felt himself perfectly innocent, he went on eating his dinner in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at length it was time to explain.  One Sunday there appeared a\r\n",
      "handsome sirloin of beef, which before noon on Monday had shrunk almost\r\n",
      "to the bare bone, and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the\r\n",
      "opening eyes of Mrs. Pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst\r\n",
      "forth, and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul\r\n",
      "play, and she would have the beef found, or she would know why.  She\r\n",
      "spoke, but no beef appeared, till Franklin, with a look of sudden\r\n",
      "recollection, cried, \"Did not I see something like a piece of beef in a\r\n",
      "basket in the dairy?--I think--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cook, as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow, grew pale; but,\r\n",
      "suddenly recovering the use of her speech, turned upon Franklin, and,\r\n",
      "with a voice of thunder, gave him the lie direct; and forthwith, taking\r\n",
      "Mrs. Pomfret by the ruffle, led the way to the dairy, declaring she could\r\n",
      "defy the world--\"that so she could, and would.\"  \"There, ma'am,\" said she\r\n",
      "kicking an empty basket which lay on the floor--\"there's malice for you.\r\n",
      "Ask him why he don't show you the beef in the basket.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought I saw--\" poor Franklin began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You thought you saw!\" cried the cook, coming close up to him with\r\n",
      "kimboed arms, and looking like a dragon; \"and pray, sir, what business\r\n",
      "has such a one as you to think you see?  And pray, ma'am, will you be\r\n",
      "pleased to speak--perhaps, ma'am, he'll condescend to obey you--ma'am,\r\n",
      "will you be pleased to forbid him my dairy? for here he comes prying and\r\n",
      "spying about; and how, ma'am, am I to answer for my butter and cream, or\r\n",
      "anything at all?  I'm sure it's what I can't pretend to, unless you do me\r\n",

      "\n",

      "turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\n",
      "opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\n",
      "and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\n",
      "made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed\n",
      "wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\n",
      "branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\n",
      "Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\n",
      "test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\n",
      "There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\n",
      "table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\n",
      "and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve\n",
      "found it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\n",
      "test-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\n",
      "by hoemoglobin,  and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,\n",
      "greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\n",
      "for which I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in\n",
      "Afghanistan, I perceive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\n",
      "hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\n",
      "mine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\n",
      "practically----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\n",
      "Don’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come\n",
      "over here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and\n",
      "drew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us have\n",
      "some fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and\n",
      "drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. “Now, I\n",
      "add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that\n",
      "the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion\n",
      "of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,\n",
      "that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As he\n",
      "spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added\n",
      "some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a\n",
      "dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom\n",
      "of the glass jar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\n",
      "child with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\n",
      "uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\n",
      "latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears\n",
      "to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been\n",
      "invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long\n",
      "ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!” I murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\n",
      "suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\n",
      "linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.\n",
      "Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,\n",
      "or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,\n",
      "and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock\n",
      "Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\n",
      "heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at his\n",
      "enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\n",
      "certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was\n",
      "Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,\n",
      "and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it\n",
      "would have been decisive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a\n",
      "laugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News\n",
      "of the Past.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock\n",
      "Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\n",
      "“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I\n",
      "dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and\n",
      "I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,\n",
      "and discoloured with strong acids.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high\n",
      "three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with\n",
      "his foot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\n",
      "complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\n",
      "that I had better bring you together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\n",
      "me. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would\n",
      "suit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\n",
      "I hope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\n",
      "do experiments. Would that annoy you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By no means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\n",
      "times, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\n",
      "sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What\n",
      "have you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\n",
      "worst of one another before they begin to live together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\n",
      "I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts\n",
      "of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices\n",
      "when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”\n",

      "anxiously.\n",
      "\n",

      "for the gods--a badly-played one----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may\n",

      "\n",
      "“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\n",

      "“All right--noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little\n",

      "finds things out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very piquant.\n",

      "WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,\n",
      " Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\n",
      "consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\n",
      "airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\n",
      "windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\n",
      "did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\n",
      "concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\n",
      "That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\n",
      "following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\n",
      "portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\n",
      "laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\n",
      "gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\n",
      "surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\n",
      "in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\n",
      "up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\n",
      "before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical\n",
      "laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long\n",
      "walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.\n",
      "Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but\n",
      "now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would\n",
      "lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving\n",
      "a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such\n",
      "a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him\n",
      "of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance\n",
      "and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\n",
      "aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\n",
      "appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\n",
      "observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\n",
      "lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\n",
      "piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;\n",
      "and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of\n",
      "alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness\n",
      "which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably\n",
      "blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of\n",
      "extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe\n",
      "when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\n",
      "much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured\n",
      "to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\n",
      "himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\n",
      "objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.\n",
      "My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was\n",
      "exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and\n",
      "break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I\n",
      "eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and\n",
      "spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\n",
      "confirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\n",
      "have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\n",
      "science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\n",
      "into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,\n",
      "and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample\n",
      "and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man\n",
      "would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some\n",
      "definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the\n",
      "exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters\n",
      "unless he has some very good reason for doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\n",
      "literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.\n",
      "Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he\n",
      "might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,\n",
      "when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory\n",
      "and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human\n",
      "being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth\n",
      "travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact\n",
      "that I could hardly realize it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of\n",
      "surprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To forget it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is\n",
      "like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\n",
      "as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\n",
      "comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\n",
      "crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that\n",
      "he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman\n",
      "is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will\n",
      "have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of\n",
      "these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It\n",
      "is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can\n",
      "distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every\n",
      "addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is\n",
      "of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing\n",
      "out the useful ones.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the Solar System!” I protested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say\n",

      "pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\n",
      "in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\n",
      "pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\n",
      "my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\n",
      "did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\n",
      "possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\n",
      "mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\n",

      "confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for\n",
      "not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to\n",
      "the subject of his own accord.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\n",
      "rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not\n",
      "yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my\n",
      "late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With\n",
      "the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt\n",
      "intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table\n",
      "and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched\n",
      "silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the\n",
      "heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted to\n",
      "show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic\n",
      "examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a\n",
      "remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was\n",
      "close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched\n",
      "and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch\n",
      "of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man’s inmost thoughts.\n",
      "Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one\n",
      "trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible\n",
      "as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear\n",
      "to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had\n",
      "arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the\n",
      "possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\n",
      "one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\n",
      "known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\n",
      "the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\n",
      "by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal\n",
      "to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\n",
      "those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\n",
      "difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\n",
      "problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\n",
      "distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\n",
      "which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\n",
      "faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look\n",
      "for. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his\n",
      "trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his\n",
      "expression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man’s calling\n",
      "is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the\n",
      "competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\n",
      "table, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\n",
      "down to my breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have marked\n",
      "it. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It\n",
      "is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these\n",
      "neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not\n",
      "practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class\n",
      "carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his\n",
      "fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As for\n",
      "the article I wrote it myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\n",
      "theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\n",
      "chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend\n",
      "upon them for my bread and cheese.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how?” I asked involuntarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\n",
      "world. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\n",
      "Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private\n",
      "ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to\n",
      "put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I\n",
      "am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of\n",
      "crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about\n",
      "misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger\n",
      "ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade\n",
      "is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a\n",
      "forgery case, and that was what brought him here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And these other people?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are\n",
      "all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\n",
      "enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\n",
      "then I pocket my fee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you\n",
      "can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they\n",
      "have seen every detail for themselves?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\n",
      "turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and\n",
      "see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge\n",
      "which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.\n",
      "Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your\n",
      "scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is\n",
      "second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our\n",
      "first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were told, no doubt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\n",
      "habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\n",
      "arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.\n",
      "There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is a\n",
      "gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly\n",
      "an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is\n",
      "dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are\n",
      "fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says\n",
      "clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and\n",
      "unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have\n",
      "seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.’ The\n",
      "whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\n",
      "came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remind\n",

      "exist outside of stories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you are\n",
      "complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in my\n",
      "opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking\n",
      "in on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of\n",
      "an hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some\n",

      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,”\n",
      " he said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him, and\n",
      "that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was\n",
      "how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four\n",
      "hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for\n",
      "detectives to teach them what to avoid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\n",
      "treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\n",

      "said to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,\n",
      "querulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know\n",
      "well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has\n",
      "ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\n",
      "talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\n",
      "result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy\n",

      "The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\n",
      "watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\n",

      "ascending the stair.\n",

      "suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\n",
      "episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have\n",
      "in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\n",
      "had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\n",
      "lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,\n",
      "“Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps\n",
      "it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a\n",
      "sergeant of Marines?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you\n",
      "were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\n",
      "difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\n",
      "street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\n",
      "fellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\n",
      "however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\n",
      "a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\n",
      "You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung\n",
      "his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\n",

      "such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\n",
      "much for a third party to find out,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done\n",
      "all that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I\n",
      "knew your taste for such things.”\n",

      "strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed\n",
      "his astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.\n",
      "Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these\n",
      "had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the\n",
      "dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had\n",
      "occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling\n",
      "at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\n",
      "of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\n",
      "blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\n",
      "become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\n",
      "Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\n",
      "imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\n",
      "red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\n",
      "hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\n",
      "intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\n",
      "centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\n",
      "the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\n",
      "ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\n",
      "age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\n",
      "a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\n",
      "and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar\n",
      "and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\n",
      "beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\n",
      "his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a\n",
      "grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\n",
      "and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\n",
      "features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\n",
      "forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\n",
      "simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\n",
      "unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has\n",
      "it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\n",
      "apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\n",
      "London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\n",
      "greeted my companion and myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I\n",
      "have seen, and I am no chicken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\n",
      "intently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to\n",
      "numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Positive!” cried both detectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--\n",
      "presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of\n",
      "the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in\n",
      "the year ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\n",
      "has all been done before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,\n",
      "feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same\n",
      "far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was\n",
      "the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness\n",
      "with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man’s lips,\n",
      "and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more\n",
      "to be learned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\n",
      "the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\n",
      "him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\n",
      "it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\n",
      "round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\n",
      "plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were\n",
      "complicated enough before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s\n",
      "nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\n",
      "pockets?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\n",
      "upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163, by\n",
      "Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,\n",
      "with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog’s head, with rubies as eyes.\n",
      "Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,\n",
      "corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose\n",

      "“At what address?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both\n",
      "from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\n",

      "return to New York.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements\n",
      "sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\n",

      "\n",

      "“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\n",

      "“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\n",
      "some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\n",
      "were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\n",
      "rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\n",
      "importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\n",
      "careful examination of the walls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in\n",
      "a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\n",
      "colleague.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\n",
      "which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand\n",
      "there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\n",
      "particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\n",
      "yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\n",
      "scrawled in blood-red letters a single word--\n",
      "\n",
      "                         RACHE.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a\n",
      "showman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the\n",
      "darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\n",
      "murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\n",
      "it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\n",
      "anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\n",
      "that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\n",
      "lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of\n",
      "the wall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in a\n",
      "depreciatory voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\n",
      "Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\n",
      "my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\n",
      "woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for\n",
      "you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but\n",
      "the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the\n",
      "little man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You\n",
      "certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\n",
      "and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other\n",
      "participant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to examine this\n",
      "room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\n",
      "glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\n",
      "about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\n",
      "lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\n",
      "he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\n",
      "himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire\n",
      "of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\n",
      "encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\n",
      "of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\n",
      "forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\n",
      "across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\n",
      "researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\n",
      "marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his\n",
      "tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place\n",
      "he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,\n",
      "and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass\n",
      "the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most\n",
      "minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\n",
      "replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he\n",
      "remarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply to\n",
      "detective work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres  of their amateur\n",
      "companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\n",
      "failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\n",
      "definite and practical end.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\n",
      "to help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\n",
      "would be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of\n",
      "sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\n",
      "investigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any help\n",
      "I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found\n",
      "the body. Can you give me his name and address?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\n",
      "duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes took a note of the address.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\n",
      "you one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\n",
      "the two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\n",
      "man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\n",
      "small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\n",
      "Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\n",
      "which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\n",
      "off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the\n",
      "finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a\n",
      "few indications, but they may assist you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other thing,\n",
      "Lestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the German\n",
      "for ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\n",
      "open-mouthed behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "IT was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\n",
      "Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\n",
      "long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\n",
      "to the address given us by Lestrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matter\n",
      "of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\n",
      "well learn all that is to be learned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as you\n",
      "pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing\n",
      "which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with\n",
      "its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain\n",
      "for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must\n",
      "have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse’s\n",
      "hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than\n",
      "that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab\n",
      "was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the\n",
      "morning--I have Gregson’s word for that--it follows that it must have\n",
      "been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two\n",
      "individuals to the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’s\n",
      "height?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\n",
      "the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\n",
      "there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride\n",
      "both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\n",
      "checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads\n",
      "him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just\n",
      "over six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And his age?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\n",
      "effort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\n",
      "of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\n",
      "Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\n",
      "There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\n",
      "life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\n",
      "advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in\n",
      "blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\n",
      "scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s\n",
      "nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\n",
      "It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a\n",
      "Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I\n",
      "have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\n",
      "distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar\n",
      "or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\n",
      "differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the florid face?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\n",
      "right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked; “the\n",
      "more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two\n",
      "men--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the\n",
      "cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?\n",
      "Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,\n",
      "since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring there? Above\n",
      "all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before\n",
      "decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling\n",
      "all these facts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My companion smiled approvingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” he\n",
      "said. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\n",
      "my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was simply\n",
      "a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting\n",
      "Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if\n",
      "you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real\n",
      "German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely\n",
      "say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who\n",
      "overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong\n",
      "channel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You\n",
      "know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,\n",
      "and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the\n",
      "conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as near\n",
      "an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”\n",

      "could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\n",
      "grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his\n",
      "strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,\n",
      "into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know myself\n",

      "discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which\n",
      "was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\n",
      "engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were\n",
      "shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\n",
      "his slumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten at\n",
      "night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White\n",
      "Hart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it\n",
      "began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove\n",
      "beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.\n",
      "Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take\n",
      "a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\n",
      "precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\n",
      "though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’\n",
      "between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\n",
      "suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\n",
      "house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\n",
      "on account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,\n",
      "though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid\n",
      "fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in\n",

      "door----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companion\n",
      "interrupted. “What did you do that for?”\n",

      "amazement upon his features.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it,\n",
      "Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and\n",
      "so lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with me.\n",
      "I ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I thought\n",
      "that maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the drains\n",
      "what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I walked back\n",
      "to the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but there wasn’t no\n",
      "sign of him nor of anyone else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was no one in the street?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\n",
      "together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\n",
      "so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a\n",
      "candle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I\n",
      "saw----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\n",

      "\n",
      "John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\n",

      "that you knows a deal more than you should.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\n",

      "that. Go on, though. What did you do next?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.\n",

      "railings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s\n",

      "taking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\n",
      "force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\n",
      "might have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you\n",
      "held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\n",
      "whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you\n",
      "that it is so. Come along, Doctor.”\n",
      "\n",

      "but obviously uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\n",
      "lodgings. “Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\n",
      "luck, and not taking advantage of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\n",
      "man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\n",
      "should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\n",
      "of criminals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\n",
      "other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\n",
      "shall have him, Doctor--I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\n",
      "thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\n",
      "missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh?\n",
      "Why shouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread of\n",
      "murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is\n",
      "to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now\n",
      "for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing\n",

      "OUR morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\n",
      "tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I\n",
      "lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.\n",
      "It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\n",
      "had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into\n",
      "it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\n",
      "baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\n",
      "impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\n",
      "difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\n",
      "owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\n",
      "malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\n",
      "Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\n",
      "depravity of the victim was no condonment  in the eyes of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s\n",
      "hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\n",
      "had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\n",
      "which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what\n",
      "had caused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\n",
      "strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so\n",
      "thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the\n",
      "victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As\n",
      "long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be\n",
      "no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident\n",
      "manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained\n",
      "all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert\n",
      "could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before\n",
      "he appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you remember\n",
      "what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\n",
      "appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\n",
      "speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\n",
      "by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\n",
      "when the world was in its childhood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\n",
      "Nature,” he answered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite\n",
      "yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardened\n",
      "after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\n",
      "Maiwand without losing my nerve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\n",
      "imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\n",
      "seen the evening paper?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\n",
      "fact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon\n",
      "the floor. It is just as well it does not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to every\n",
      "paper this morning immediately after the affair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It\n",
      "was the first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road,\n",
      "this morning,” it ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\n",
      "between the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\n",
      "221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of these\n",
      "dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I have\n",
      "no ring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well. It\n",
      "is almost a facsimile.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.\n",
      "If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\n",
      "to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the\n",
      "ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber’s\n",
      "body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he\n",
      "discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in\n",
      "possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had\n",
      "to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have\n",
      "been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that\n",
      "man’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him\n",
      "that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving\n",
      "the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the\n",
      "evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His\n",
      "eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should\n",
      "he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding\n",
      "of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will\n",
      "come. You shall see him within an hour?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man,\n",
      "and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\n",
      "anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with\n",
      "the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\n",
      "favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer\n",
      "to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your\n",
      "pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary\n",
      "way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him too\n",
      "hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly.\n",
      "That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a\n",
      "queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--‘De Jure inter\n",
      "Gentes’--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’\n",

      "faded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William\n",
      "Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\n",
      "writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\n",
      "softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\n",

      "opened it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\n",
      "could not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one\n",
      "began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\n",
      "one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\n",
      "listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble\n",
      "tap at the door.\n",

      "dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\n",
      "stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\n",
      "with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\n",
      "had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to\n",
      "keep my countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\n",
